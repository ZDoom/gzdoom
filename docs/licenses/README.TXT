This software uses the "Dynamic Universal Music Bibliotheque" library for
MOD music playback. See dumb.txt for original license. The version used,
however, has been heavily modified from its original form and is the same
version used by the foobar2000 component foo_dumb as of mid-2008, found at

This software uses the OPL emulator from MAME 0.95. Playback of MUS files
