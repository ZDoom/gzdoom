# GZDoom

https://zdoom.org/

GZDoom is a modern, feature-rich source port for the classic game DOOM. A continuation of ZDoom, GZDoom enhances the original DOOM engine, providing advanced features like high-resolution graphics, dynamic lighting, 3D floors, and extensive modding support for modern operating systems.

GZDoom is free and open-source software, built and maintained by a dedicated community of developers and enthusiasts.
