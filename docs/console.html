			<h2 id="about">About the console</h2>
			<p>ZDoom's console is a powerful tool for interacting with the game engine directly.
			There are two methods for accessing it:</p>
			<ol><li>Open the options menu and select "Go to console."</li>
			<li>Press a key bound to the <a href="#toggleconsole">toggleconsole</a> command. The normal key for this
			is the ` key (the key to the left of 1 and above Tab).</li></ol>
			<p>Once the console is open, you can type in commands and they will appear at the bottom of the console.
			If you type a command that is wider than the console, the command view scrolls to fit the most recently
			part of the command on the screen. Press Enter to execute the command.</p>
			<p>To close the console and return to the game, press ` again or press Esc.</p>
			<p>The console is divided into three distinct sections:</p>
			<ol><li>The largest part of the console is the console buffer. This shows the last 32768 bytes printed to the
			console (which are also printed to the top of the screen when the console is closed).</li>
			<li>Underneath the console buffer is the command line. This is where you enter all your commands at.</li>
			<li>Just beneath the command line is the ZDoom version number. If you're not sure what version of ZDoom
			you're playing, just open the console and look in its lower-right corner.</li></ol>
			<p>There are several special keys that function in the console:</p>
			<blockquote>
			<dl>
			<dt>Enter</dt>
			<dd>Execute the current command line.</dd>
			<dt>Tab</dt>
			<dd>Move forward through the possible completions for the current command. To use this feature, type the
			first few characters of a command or cvar, then press Tab. For example, if you type <code>cl_</code>
			and then press Tab, the first press of the Tab key will list all the possible choices that begin with cl_.
			Each time you press Tab after that, the next choice in the list will be placed on the command line.</dd>
			<dt>Shift+Tab</dt>
			<dd>Move backward through the possible completions for the current command.</dd>
			<dt>Left arrow</dt>
			<dd>Move the cursor left on the command line.</dd>
			<dt>Right arrow</dt>
			<dd>Move the cursor right on the command line.</dd>
			<dt>Home</dt>
			<dd>Move the cursor to the first character on the command line.</dd>
			<dt>End</dt>
			<dd>Move the cursor to the last character on the command line.</dd>
			<dt>Backspace</dt>
			<dd>Delete the character to the left of the cursor</dd>
			<dt>Del</dt>
			<dd>Delete the character underneath the cursor</dd>
			<dt>Up arrow</dt>
			<dd>Scroll backward through the most recently typed command lines.</dd>
			<dt>Down arrow</dt>
			<dd>Scroll forward through the most recently typed command lines.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrl+C</dt>
			<dd>Copy the current command line to the clipboard.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrl+V</dt>
			<dd>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the command line.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrl+D</dt>
			<dd>When pressed on an empty command line, executes the contents of the <a href="#con_ctrl_d">con_ctrl_d</a>
			cvar as if it had been typed at the command line.</dd>
			<dt>Page Up</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer up one line.</dd>
			<dt>Page Down</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer down one line.</dd>
			<dt>Shift+Page Up</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer up one page.</dd>
			<dt>Shift+Page Down</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer down one page.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrl+Home</dt>
			<dd>Scroll to the top of the console buffer.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrlr+End</dt>
			<dd>Scroll to the bottom of the console buffer.</dd>
			</dl></blockquote>
			<p>You can also use your mouse wheel to scroll through different things on the console:</p>
			<blockquote>
			<dl>
			<dt>Wheel Up</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer up three lines.</dd>
			<dt>Wheel Down</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer down three lines.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrl+Wheel Up</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer up one page.</dd>
			<dt>Ctrl+Wheel Down</dt>
			<dd>Scroll the console buffer down one page.</dd>
			<dt>Shift+Wheel Up</dt>
			<dd>Scroll backward through the most recently typed command lines.</dd>
			<dt>Shift+Wheel Down</dt>
			<dd>Scroll forward through the most recently typed command lines.</dd>
			</dl></blockquote>
			<h2 id="using">Using this reference</h2>
			<p>This reference lists every cvar and command found in ZDoom. To make browsing easier,
			they have been split into different sections according to category. If you already know the
			name of the command or cvar you want, you can use the <a href="#index">index</a> to jump
			directly to it.</p>
			<p>Because cvars are like special commands, there is no separation between commands and cvars.
			However, each entry is color coded:</p>
			<div class="c">command <i>required-parameter</i> [<i>optional-parameter</i>]</div>
			<div class="b">Green entries are commands. Commands are actions that the game can perform.
			<p>The command's name and any parameters it takes are listed at the top of the box.
			The parameters are all listed in <i>italics</i>. If a parameter is not required for the command
			to operate, then it is surrounded by square brackets [<i>like this</i>].</p>
			<p>The rest
			of the box is devoted to a description of the command, which tells what the command does and what
			any of its parameters do.</p></div>
			<div class="v">cvar</div>
			<div class="t">type: default</div>
			<div class="d">Cyan entries are cvars. A cvar (short for console variable) contains a value that the
			game uses to control its operations.
			<p>Like commands, the first part of the box contains the cvar's name. However, parameters are never
			listed because cvars always have one optional parameter. If you use a cvar without a parameter,
			the cvar's current value is printed to the console. If you provide a parameter for the cvar, then that
			will become the cvar's new value.</p>
			<p>The next part of the box is the cvar's type and default value. The type determines what kinds of
			values the cvar can hold, and its default is the value it will have when the game can't find an .ini
			to load its settings from.</p>
			<p>The remainder of the box is used to describe how the cvar is used.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="vf">flag cvar</div>
			<div class="tf">flag in <i>other cvar</i>: default</div>
			<div class="df">Blue entries are flag cvars. These are similar to the other types of cvars, except they
			don't have any values of their own. Instead, they pick apart the contents of another cvar so that you don't
			need to remember any numbers to use the other cvar.</div>
			<h2 id="cvartypes">Console variable types</h2>
			There are seven types of cvars:
			<dl>
				<dt>boolean</dt>
				<dd>
					This type of variable represents a yes/no or on/off value. It can only be set 
					to true or false. As shorthand, setting a boolean variable to 0 will set it to 
					false, and setting it to anything non-zero will set it to true.</dd>
				<dt>integer</dt>
				<dd>
					This is an ordinary number without a decimal point. For example, 1 is an 
					integer, but 1.2 is not.</dd>
				<dt>float</dt>
				<dd>
					This is an ordinary number that can have a decimal point.</dd>
				<dt>string</dt>
				<dd>
					This is a series of text characters enclosed in quotes: For example, "Felix 
					loitered lecherously on the lot" is a string. If you removed the quotes around 
					it, then it would not be a string.
					<p>If you need to use quotes inside a string, preface it with a backslash.</p>
					<pre>Are you "The One" of old?</pre>
					would be written like this as a string:
					<pre>"Are you \"The One\" of old?"</pre>
				</dd>
				<dt>color</dt>
				<dd>
					This type of variable is a series of three hexadecimal numbers representing the 
					amounts of red, green, and blue (in that order) in a color. For example, pure 
					red would be represented as "ff 00 00". As a shorthand, you can set a color 
					variable with one of several color names, and the RGB values will be set for 
					you.</dd>
				<dt>GUID</dt>
				<dd>
					This type variable is used to hold a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). It is 
					currently used only by <a href="#joy_guid">joy_guid</a>.</dd>
				<dt>flag</dt>
				<dd>
					This type of variable mirrors a setting in dmflags or dmflags2. Setting its 
					value will set the corresponding value in one of those variables, and getting 
					its value will get the corresponding value from one of the other two variables. 
					This is designed to make using dmflags easier, because you don't have to 
					memorize any numbers.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<h2 id="obsolete">Obsolete commands and variables</h2>
			<p>The following commands and variables were present in ZDoom 1.22 but have been 
				removed:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>configver</dt>
				<dd>
					This variable was used by ZDoom to determine which version wrote the zdoom.cfg. 
					This has been replaced by the [LastRun] section of zdoom.ini and is no longer 
					accessible from the console.</dd>
				<dt>def_patch</dt>
				<dd>
					You can now have multiple dehacked patches loaded automatically. To do this, 
					add a [Doom.DefaultDehacked] section to <a href="#whereisini">zdoom.ini</a> like 
					this:
					<pre>[Doom.DefaultDehacked]
Path=my_first_patch.deh
Path=my_second_patch.deh</pre>
					You can add as many Path= lines as you like. Not all Dehacked patches will work 
					well together. Changes made by patches listed later will override any changes 
					made by patches listed earlier that affect the same things. If you specify any 
					patches with -deh or -bex at the command line, then those patches will be 
					loaded instead of the ones listed here.</dd>
				<dt>i_remapkeypad</dt>
				<dd>
					The keypad is never remapped to non-keypad keys anymore. This cvar came from a 
					time when you could only assign a function to at most two different keys. Now 
					that Quake-style keybindings are possible, this cvar is no longer necessary and 
					has been a source of confusion.</dd>
				<dt>impulse</dt>
				<dd>
					Use the new <a href="#slot">slot</a> command instead.</dd>
				<dt>nobfgaim</dt>
				<dd>
					This was renamed to <a href="#sv_nobfgaim">sv_nobfgaim</a> and is now a part of <a href="#dmflags2">
						dmflags2</a>.</dd>
				<dt>vid_noptc</dt>
				<dd>
					PTC is no longer used for video, so there is nothing for this cvar to disable.</dd>
				<dt>testgibs</dt>
				<dd>
					This variable never did anything useful in 1.22.
				</dd>
				<dt>sv_friction</dt>
				<dd>
					Friction was never configurable from the console.</dd>
			</dl>
			<div id="buttons">
				<h2>Button commands</h2>
				Button commands are commands that represent buttons and come in pairs. Each 
				"button" has a command prefixed by a + and another corresponding command 
				prefixed by a -. The + version of the command simulates pushing the button, and 
				the - version of the command simulates releasing the button.
				<p>When you bind a command that begins with + to a key, releasing the key will 
					automatically execute the same command with the + replaced by a -. Note that 
					this works for aliases as well as the commands listed here. This provides a 
					useful way to bind multiple actions to a single key. Suppose you want the 
					normal Doom behavior of moving forward and using when you double click the 
					right mouse button. If you use the commands
				</p>
				<pre>bind mouse2 +forward<br />doublebind mouse2 +use</pre>
				<p>ZDoom will move you forward when you press the right mouse button. When you 
					double click it, you will press use, but you will not move forward. To simulate 
					the standard Doom behavior, you can replace the doublebind command with these 
					three commands instead:
				</p>
				<pre>alias +useforward "+use; +forward"<br />alias -useforward "-use; -forward"<br />doublebind mouse2 +useforward</pre>
				Now when you double click the right mouse button, the +useforward alias will be 
				executed. Because +useforward's name begins with a + releasing the right mouse 
				button will execute the -useforward alias (whether or not -useforward is 
				defined).
				<p>This behavior of executing a - command when a key is released applies only to 
					the first command or alias bound to the key. If you bind a key to "+forward; 
					+right", releasing the key will execute the command "-forward; +right" and <i>not</i>
					"-forward; -right". As shown above, you can use aliases to get the correct 
					behavior.</p>
				<p>Another trick you can do with aliases is to create a key that only executes the 
					+ command without executing the - command. If you wanted a key that will make 
					you move forward when you press it, and will keep you moving forward even after 
					releasing it, you can use an alias like this:</p>
				<pre>alias go "+forward"</pre>
				<p>Then instead of binding +forward to a key, you bind go to the key instead. This 
					works because go does not begin with a + so nothing will happen when you 
					release the key&mdash;ZDoom only looks at the command actually bound to the key 
					to determine if it should execute a - command when the key is released; it does 
					not look inside aliases.
				</p>

				<h2>Customization</h2>
				<div class="c" id="addkeysection">addkeysection <i>menu-heading</i> <i>ini-section-name</i></div>
				<div class="b">This command does two things. First, it adds a new heading called <i>menu-heading</i>
					to the <a href="#menu_keys">controls menu</a>. You can use the <a href="#addmenukey">
						addmenukey</a> command to add your own custom keys beneath this heading. 
					Second, it loads all the bindings from the corresponding <i>ini-section-name</i>
					section in zdoom.ini. You can use this command multiple times to create 
					different sections in the menu and ini for different sets of commands. If you 
					use a <i>menu-heading</i> that was already added to the menu, new controls

				</div>
				<div class="c" id="addmenukey">addmenukey <i>description</i> <i>command</i></div>
				<div class="b">Adds a new control to the controls menu. <i>Description</i> is the

					only if that weapon is not already in a slot. If the weapon is already present 
					in a slot (either the slot specified to addslotdefault or some other slot),

				<div class="c" id="alias">alias <i>new-command</i> [<i>command-string</i>]</div>
				<div class="b">If specified with no parameters, will display a list of all current

					to the list of aliases as <i>new-command</i>. For example, to create a new 
					command to kill the monsters on the level, you can use the command:
					<pre>alias massacre "kill monsters"</pre>
					<p>Then you can use the newly created <code>massacre</code> command to kill all the

				<h2>Input - Joystick</h2>
				<p>Joystick support in ZDoom 2 has been extended considerably since ZDoom 1.22. It 
					is now based around five virtual axes and a fully reconfigurable controller. 
					Several cvars below bind a real joystick axis to a virtual axis. The virtual 
					axes are listed below:</p>
				<ol start="0">
					<li>
						None: The joystick axis is unused.</li>
					<li>
						Yaw: The joystick axis controls looking left and right.</li>
					<li>
						Pitch: The joystick axis controls looking up and down.</li>
					<li>
						Forward: The joystick axis controls moving forward and backward.</li>
					<li>
						Strafe: The joystick axis controls moving left and right.</li>
					<li>
						Up: The joystick axis controls moving up and down.</li></ol>
				<p>Each real axis also has a corresponding threshold cvar. This controls how far 
					the axis must be moved from its centered position before its movement will be 
					registered with the game. This distance is also known as the axis' dead zone. 
					If you find that you are "twitching" are moving very slowly when you have your 
					controller centered, you should increase the threshold for the corresponding 
					axis until the problem goes away. A value of 0 means the axis has no dead zone, 
					and a value of 1 means the dead zone covers the entire range of the axis' 
					movement.</p>
