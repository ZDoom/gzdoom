This applies to the Linux version. Ignore it if you aren't using Linux.

INSTALLING ZDOOM
----------------
You need SDL installed. Go get it from http://www.libsdl.org/ if you don't
have it already.

You also need FMOD. Get it from http://www.fmod.org/

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
----------------------
Get and install nasm from http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/

Edit the makefile as needed. Then run make. Make install probably
doesn't work right now, so you can find the executable in
src/linux/release.

INSTALLING PRECOMPILED BINARIES
-------------------------------
I don't have any yet.

INSTALLING IWADS
----------------
Copy your DOOM IWAD files to /usr/share/zdoom. Alternatively, you can
keep the IWADs somewhere else and create symbolic links to them in
/usr/local/share/zdoom.

ZDoom will also look for IWADs in the current directory, ~/.zdoom, and
$DOOMWADDIR.

COMPILING UNDER OSF/1
---------------------
OSF/1 is no longer supported. (Not that it ever really was, but now I
have no access to OSF/1 machines, so I can't even test a minimal build.)
