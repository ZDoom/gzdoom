===============================================================================

This document discusses only the additions ZDoom makes to the UDMF 
specification.

=======================================
I. Grammar / Syntax
=======================================

    No changes.

=======================================
II. Implementation Semantics
=======================================

------------------------------------
II.A : Storage and Retrieval of Data
------------------------------------

No changes.

-----------------------------------
II.B : Storage Within Archive Files
-----------------------------------

In addition to the base specification ZDoom recognizes the following lumps
between the TEXTMAP and ENDMAP lumps:

    BEHAVIOR = contains compiled ACS code
    DIALOGUE = contains compiled Strife conversation scripts.
    ZNODES = Nodes (must be stored as extended GL nodes. Compression is allowed
	                but deprecated for portability reasons.)
    BLOCKMAP = blockmap. It is recommended not to include this lump in UDMF maps.
    REJECT = reject table. Recommended use is for special effects only.
    
    Lumps starting with 'SCRIPT' are guaranteed to be ignored by ZDoom so they
    can be used to store ACS and dialogue script sources.
    
--------------------------------
II.C : Implementation Dependence
--------------------------------

ZDoom supports all namespaces defined in the base specification and adds two new
ones:
    "ZDoom"
    "ZDoomTranslated"
    
The only difference between these two namespaces is how line, thing and sector
specials are handled:

'ZDoom' uses Hexen type specials which are ZDoom's native implementation.

'ZDoomTranslated' uses Doom-type specials. Such maps have to be processed by
a special translator. A special translator is a text lump that defines how
Doom-format specials are translated into Hexen-format specials. By default
each game defines its own translation table but these can be overridden in
MAPINFO. It is the mapper's responsibility to choose the correct translation
table for a map.


=======================================
III. Standardized Fields
=======================================

ZDoom's namespaces implement all fields from the standard, regardless of
any restrictions mentioned in the spec.
In particular, the 'ZDoomTranslated' namespaces implements thing specials.
These will ignore the implicit trigger type and triggering semantics are the
same as for native maps.
The only field not fully supported is the thing's 'friend' field. ZDoom does
not offer MBF's friendly monster implementation and will remap any use of this
field to 'strifeally', even for the 'Doom' namespace.

In addition to the standard fields, ZDoom defines the following:
Note: All <bool> fields default to false unless mentioned otherwise.

   linedef
   {
      alpha = <float>;          // Translucency of this line, default is 1.0
      renderstyle = <string>;   // Render style, can be "translucent" or "add",
                                // default is "translucent".
      playeruseback = <bool>;   // New SPAC flag, true = player can use from back side.
      anycross = <bool>;        // New SPAC flag, true = any non-projectile 
                                // crossing will trigger this line
      monsteractivate = <bool>; // Monsters can trigger this line.
                                // For compatibility only because this flag's 
                                // semantics can not be fully reproduced with
                                // explicit trigger flags.
      blockplayers = <bool>;    // Line blocks players' movement.
      blockeverything = <bool>; // Line blocks everything.
      firstsideonly = <bool>;   // Line can only be triggered from the front side.
      zoneboundary = <bool>;    // Line is a boundary for sound reverb zones.
      clipmidtex = <bool>;      // Line's mid textures are clipped to floor and ceiling.
      wrapmidtex = <bool>;      // Line's mid textures are wrapped.
      midtex3d = <bool>;        // Actors can walk on mid texture.
      checkswitchrange = <bool>;// Switches can only be activated when vertically reachable.
      blockprojectiles = <bool>;// Line blocks all projectiles
      blockuse = <bool>;		// Line blocks all use actions
                    
   }
   
   sidedef
   {
      scalex_top = <float>;    // X scale for upper texture, Default = 1.0.
      scaley_top = <float>;    // y scale for upper texture, Default = 1.0.
      scalex_mid = <float>;    // X scale for mid texture, Default = 1.0.

      offsetx_mid = <float>;    // X offset for mid texture, Default = 0.0.
      offsety_mid = <float>;    // y offset for mid texture, Default = 0.0.
      offsetx_bottom = <float>; // X offset for lower texture, Default = 0.0.
      offsety_bottom = <float>; // y offset for lower texture, Default = 0.0.
                                // When global texture offsets are used they will
                                // be added on top of these values.
      light = <integer>;        // This side's light level. Default is 0.
      lightabsolute = <bool>;   // true = 'light' is an absolute value. Default is 
                                // relative to the owning sector's light level.
      nofakecontrast = <bool>;	// Disables use of fake contrast on this sidedef.

      clipmidtex = <bool>;      // Side's mid textures are clipped to floor and ceiling.
      wrapmidtex = <bool>;      // Side's mid textures are wrapped.
	  nodecals = <bool>;		// Disables decals on the sidedef.
   }
   
   sector
   {
      xpanningfloor = <float>;	      // X texture offset of floor texture, Default = 0.0.
      ypanningfloor = <float>;        // Y texture offset of floor texture, Default = 0.0.

      rotationceiling = <float>;      // Rotation of ceiling texture in degrees, Default = 0.0.
      lightfloor = <integer>;         // The floor's light level. Default is 0.
      lightceiling = <integer>;       // The ceiling's light level. Default is 0.
      lightfloorabsolute = <bool>;    // true = 'lightfloor' is an absolute value. Default is 
                                      // relative to the owning sector's light level.
      lightceilingabsolute = <bool>;  // true = 'lightceiling' is an absolute value. Default is 
                                      // relative to the owning sector's light level.
      gravity = <float>;              // Sector's gravity. Default is 1.0.
      lightcolor = <integer>;         // Sector'S light color as RRGGBB value, default = 0xffffff.
      fadecolor = <integer>;          // Sector'S fog color as RRGGBB value, default = 0x000000.
      desaturation = <float>;         // Color desaturation factor. 0 = none, 1 = full, default = 0.
      silent = <bool>;                // Actors in this sector make no sound,
      nofallingdamage = <bool>;		  // Falling damage is disabled in this sector
      dropactors = <bool>;            // Actors drop with instantly moving floors (*)
	  norespawn = <bool>;             // Players can not respawn in this sector
	  soundsequence = <string>;       // The sound sequence to play when this sector moves. Placing a
	                                  // sound sequence thing in the sector will override this property.
      
      * Note about dropactors

        The spec requires this to be false by default. Currently, however ZDoom assumes this to be true
      for Doom format maps so any map converter converting to the ZDoomTranslated namespace should
      set this flag for each tagged sector.
      
   }
   
   thing
   {
      skill# = <bool>			// Unlike the base spec, # can range from 1-8.
                                // 8 is the maximum amount of skills the skill 
                                // menu can display.
      class# = <bool>			// Unlike the base spec, # can range from 1-8.
                                // 8 is the maximum amount of classes the class
                                // menu can display.
   }
								
  

*** Special notes for map format conversions:

   Setting the line's ID via special is not supported so any special using
   this option must be converted to use the line's ID field instead.
   Unless mentioned differently the arg being used to define the line ID
   should be set to 0.
   The following line specials are affected:
   
   121: Line_SetIdentification, arg 0
   208: TranslucentLine, arg0 (arg0 must be preserved)
     1: Polyobj_StartLine, arg3
     5: Polyobj_ExplicitLine, arg4
   181: Plane_Align, arg2
   215: Teleport_Line, arg0
   222: Scroll_Texture_Model, arg0 (arg0 must be preserved)
   
   Some specials also allow setting the extended flags. These must also be
   converted to explicitly setting the flags through the defined map fields.
   This affects the following specials:
   
   121: Line_SetIdentification, arg1
   208: TranslucentLine, arg3
   
   These args are to be converted as follows to flags, bit by bit:
   
   Bit 0 (Value   1): zoneboundary
   Bit 1 (Value   2): jumpover
   Bit 2 (Value   4): blockfloaters
   Bit 3 (Value   8): clipmidtex
   Bit 4 (Value  16): wrapmidtex
   Bit 5 (Value  32): midtex3d
   Bit 6 (Value  64): checkswitchrange
   Bit 7 (Value 128): firstsideonly
   
   When used in special 208 this arg should be cleared afterward.
   
   Special 121 is not being used by UDMF maps in ZDoom and should be completely
   deleted after conversion.

1.2 21.08.2008
Added smooth lighting option to linedefs

1.3 12.12.2008
Added NoRespawn sector flag
Fixed lightfloor and lightceiling properties for sectors. They are of type 
integer, not float
