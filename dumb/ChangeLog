======================= foo_dumb part =================================

2007-01-26 23:42 UTC - kode54
- Added CPUID specialization for it_filter() so I can release it.

2007-01-26 22:50 UTC - kode54
- Moved IT S70-2 effects alongside the rest of S7x so they all trigger after
  paired notes.
- Integrated note on/cut ramping with volume transition ramping to reduce
  setup/cleanup overhead of calling render_playing and the resampler functions
  for single samples.
- Note on/cut ramping scaled from 7 sample logarithmic and 256 sample linear to
  .75ms and 5ms respectively, both linear.
- Integrated the pattern looping changes from DUMB 0.9.3, since a few files
  seemed to be broken. The XM-only features still needed to be flagged for XM
  so they won't break MOD.
- Implemented SSE replacement for it_filter() which is actually twice as fast.

2007-01-24 09:37 UTC - kode54
- Version is now 0.9.8.3

2007-01-24 08:34 UTC - kode54
- Implemented 669 running effects correctly.

2007-01-23 17:42 UTC - kode54
- Fixed IT reader decompression to support compression+delta on files created
  with 2.15 or newer.

2007-01-22 18:54 UTC - kode54
- Implemented 669 running effects, nasty stuff.

2007-01-22 16:40 UTC - kode54
- Fixed MOD loading step in case any files fall through another loader first.
  (if asked twice.mod)

2007-01-21 19:47 UTC - kode54
- Implemented crappy fixed end of sample volume ramping.

2007-01-21 17:43 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now ignores sample header length, as Sk@le Tracker fills this with
  nonsense.

2007-01-21 14:21 UTC - kode54
- Fixed a bug in IT renderer / get_true_pan that caused it to crash on IT files
  with instruments enabled upon hitting an invalid instrument change.

2006-12-26 06:41 UTC - kode54
- Fixed sample rate reporting for when extra dynamic info is turned off.

2006-11-01 00:50 UTC - kode54
- Resamplers now return immediately if the fixed point delta is zero.
- IT renderer now cuts existing notes when it reaches a note where the instrument
  references an invalid sample. (jumping under trees.it)
- Version is now 0.9.8.2

2006-10-14 08:33 UTC - kode54
- IT renderer pattern loop processor now resets the rows played to clear table
  per channel regardless of whether order changed since last loop start was
  initiated. This is correct, since two pattern loop starts in a row means that
  a loop will never jump to the first loop point.

2006-10-12 06:28 UTC - kode54
- STM reader checks for more values after the song name, reports the correct
  order list size, and ignores samples which are shorter than four bytes or
  have a default volume of zero.

2006-10-08 03:51 UTC - kode54
- Added CP437 graphics to text conversion functions.

2006-10-07 05:24 UTC - kode54
- Simplified volume ramping update code, reducing the size of the resampler code
  considerably.
- Bumped the volume ramping precision to 24 bits of fraction precision, which is
  needed by Sweetsin.xm.
- Moved sample rate reporting to dynamic info as requested by Peter, since it's
  not a property of the files themselves, but user configurable.
- Version is now 0.9.8.1

2006-10-07 03:42 UTC - kode54
- Changed DSMF sample loader to ignore unknown flags instead of blowing an error.

2006-09-25 17:39 UTC - kode54
- Added hack to MOD loader for when sample start is specified in bytes instead of
  words.

2006-09-19 15:05 UTC - kode54
- Shuffled finetune calculation into the correct position, immediately applied
  as delta is calculated from note.
- Promoted IT_SAMPLE finetune property to signed short as char is insufficient
  for full semitone range. (+/- 256)
- Changed resampler to use full 64-bit comparison for todo variable range checking
  which should hopefully eliminate any further problems with pitch slides which go
  out of range.
- Version is now 0.9.8

2006-06-16 19:10 UTC - kode54
- Fixed MOD loader FLT8 handler so it halves the order list after it's allocated
  and loaded.
- Unified renderer and loop restarting for playback and seeking, and made seeking
  abortable.

2006-06-16 09:12 UTC - kode54
- Fixed PSM subsong info reporting.

2006-06-15 21:23 UTC - kode54
- Added finetune property to IT_SAMPLE, modified ASY, MOD, MTM, old PSM, and XM
  to use it instead of adjusting the C5 speed, so that finetune effect overrides
  rather than compounding sample finetune.

2006-06-10 18:10 UTC - kode54
- Fixed volume ramping.

2006-06-09 16:48 UTC - kode54
- Ported most of DUMB 0.9.3 over, except for the conflicting pattern loop change

2006-06-03 02:13 UTC - kode54
- Implemented ASYLUM Music Format support.

2006-06-02 22:06 UTC - kode54
- Fixed finite looping for speed 0 and global volume 0 triggers.
- Reset loop count when seeking backwards.

2006-06-02 21:20 UTC - kode54
- IT renderer now supports pattern jump and break to row on the same row.
  (coffee-blues 3.mod)
- Version is now 0.9.7.5

2006-06-02 20:25 UTC - kode54
- Empty pattern scanner now returns the correct value for completely empty
  pattern structures, and also checks for lists of empty rows.

2006-06-01 00:47 UTC - kode54
- STM reader reads effects properly now.

2006-05-31 23:15 UTC - kode54
- Implemented STM support.
- Version is now 0.9.7.4

2006-05-31 20:12 UTC - kode54
- Finished implementing working fading support.

2006-05-31 19:09 UTC - kode54
- Implemented fading support.

2006-05-31 18:31 UTC - kode54
- Removed context dialog from resources.

2006-05-30 03:57 UTC - kode54
- IT reader works around a broken file that has several of the instruments
  offset by two bytes from their indicated file offsets. Since the hack
  only checks for offset by two null bytes, it also assumes that the two
  bytes it can't read from the end are also zero. (bz_ult9.it)
- IT reader treats null instrument/sample/pattern offsets as empty items.
  (flight2.it, sherri.it)

2006-05-30 00:04 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now truncates instrument envelope lengths to 12, and performs
  some basic envelope loop checking, similar to Open ModPlug Tracker.
  (revive_nimnone.xm)

2006-05-27 22:40 UTC - kode54
- S3M reader defaults to maximum (128) global volume when the header value is
  either zero or greater than 64. (darkness2.s3m)

2006-05-23 00:06 UTC - kode54
- Changed module format load order priority to check all signatures before
  attempting MOD now, and then only 15 sample module for MOD/MDZ. This should
  hopefully cut back on problems with N formats renamed to MOD.
- Version is now 0.9.7.4

2006-05-22 21:44 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now supports up to 256 instruments, even though FT2 only
  supports up to 128. ModPlug Tracker again. (no_utndgs2.xm)
- g_open_module now supports other files misnamed as .MOD (hilse.mod .it)

2006-05-22 18:43 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now ignores when instrument header contains a sample header size
  of 0, when it should be 0x28. (neptune_*.xm)
- S3M reader was using the incorrect index into component for sample packing
  when reading sample data. Was using n, should have been m.

2006-05-22 17:26 UTC - kode54
- IT renderer may have a bug with its time_lost / loop handling. Switchover
  from sustain loop would compound time_lost onto itself for every note-off.
  I'm not sure if this crap is even doing the right thing, especially in the
  case of a sample with a sustain loop, but no main loop. Working around for
  now by zeroing time_lost after note-off. (hall8.it)
- S3M reader ignores effects outside of 1-25 range so nothing can hit
  internal effects which are XM or PTM only. (N4.S3M)
- IT reader now supports ModPlug Tracker extensions for up to 4000 samples
  and mapping them with instruments. (hallowe.it.it)
- XM reader now supports instrument vibrato 4, random. Yet another ModPlug
  extension. (hcw-st.xm)

2006-05-21 02:11 UTC - kode54
- S3M reader correctly reads all 24 bits of the sample memory segment
  offset, fixing at least one file with >1MB of sample data (d-t-x_x.s3m)
- XM reader stops reading instruments when it has at least one valid
  instrument and encounters an error, fixing at least one file with
  too high instrument count in the header (drx-chri.xm)
- IT reader ignores instrument header signatures, since there seem to
  be files with bad signatures on unused/filler instruments (dsouls.it)
- MOD reader can now be restricted to handling 31 sample files with
  legal/known signatures only, so frontend can fall back on restricted
  MOD loading for files with incorrect extensions (dreamer_0g.s3m)
- Version is now 0.9.7.2

2006-05-20 xx:xx UTC - kode54
- Modified silence skipping to hack around some "S L O W" effects crap
  and a misused break to row effect

2006-03-27 07:51 UTC - kode54
- Changed RIFF AMFF loader to ignore one unknown sample flag and
  be a little more flexible with the INST chunk handler

2005-11-07 05:00 UTC - kode54
- Added generic RIFF module handler and AM/AMFF format readers

- Version is now 0.9.6.2

2005-05-29 16:49 UTC - kode54
- Implemented support for modplug packed samples in MOD reader (meh)
- Version is now 0.9.6.1

2005-05-20 06:08 UTC - kode54
- UMX handler now ignores file type (SpaceMarines.umx, Starseek.umx report "s3m" but contain IT)
- UMX stops at the first matching resource (Kran32.umx, contains two Music entries for the same block of data)
- Version is now 0.9.6

2005-01-27 21:02 UTC - kode54
- Quick bug fix for Repeat One, seek() should be clearing eof flag
- Version is now 0.9.5.8

2005-01-17 16:25 UTC - kode54
- XM pattern loader is now more lenient with truncated pattern data
- Version is now 0.9.5.7

2005-01-12 20:19 UTC - kode54
- Added .mod/.mdz check to track indexer in case of MOD with "PSM " in song name :)
- Version is now 0.9.5.6

2005-01-12 19:11 UTC - kode54
- Fixed a bug in 669 loader

- Touched up .mod sample truncation handling again
- Version is now 0.9.5.5

2004-10-21 06:02 UTC - kode54

- Version is now 0.9.5.4

2004-10-18 04:50 UTC - kode54
- Corrected 669 tempo and speed handling, although the tone portamento still seems to be a bit off
- Reenabled down ramping, always using 1/512s logarithmic decay
- Version is now 0.9.5.3

2004-10-17 06:25 UTC - kode54
- Disabled the down ramping code, as the old click remover seems to behave better in more places

2004-10-17 00:26 UTC - kode54
- Added file remaining hack to skip remaining but unused patterns in Iguana's demo MODs
- Modified MOD buffered reader and sample data loader to avoid unnecessary dumbfile calls when size of operation is zero
- Version is now 0.9.5.2

2004-10-16 23:22 UTC - kode54
- Changed sample truncation behavior in MOD and 669 to be consistent
- Added support for a couple of obscure MOD signatures used by some PC demo, just to support their delta samples natively
- Version is now 0.9.5.1

2004-10-16 19:44 UTC - kode54
- 669 loader is lenient with truncated sample data

- Tweaked XM amiga vibrato a bit, should be more correct now

2004-10-14 21:58 UTC - kode54
- Set sample offset has memory even in MOD
- Version is now 0.9.4

2004-10-12 06:14 UTC - kode54
- Tweaked around with volume ramping crap some more. Still a mess, still nowhere near perfect. Bleh.
- Added per-sample resampling quality limits
- Added auto chip sample detection

2004-10-10 07:23 UTC - kode54
- Implemented volume change ramping as well... Holy shit, what a fucking mess.

2004-10-09 23:50 UTC - kode54

2004-10-06 22:08 UTC - kode54
- Fixed volume swing
- Fixed logarithmic vibrato so it only activates on XM w/ Amiga frequency table

- Sample offset is no longer reapplied during pattern breaks
- Version is now 0.9.3.4

2004-10-05 23:57 UTC - kode54
- MOD/XM pattern break effect >63 breaks to row 0

2004-10-05 23:34 UTC - kode54
- Implemented FastTracker 2 logarithmic vibrato
- Implemented FastTracker 2 ramp up/down and square wave forms... Maybe it would be faster if I calculated that crap
  instead of using tables.

2004-10-05 19:38 UTC - kode54
- Implemented instrument random volume and panning variation, but maybe the offset should be a member of IT_CHANNEL
  instead of IT_PLAYING...

2004-10-05 19:03 UTC - kode54
- Panbrello position persists for the life of the voice, depth is the same, but is reset to zero
  if channel panning is changed

2004-10-05 18:49 UTC - kode54
- Fixed pitch-pan with negative separation level
- Changed instrument envelope control

2004-10-04 14:25 UTC - kode54

- Version is now 0.9.3.3

2004-10-04 13:27 UTC - kode54

2004-10-02 14:28 UTC - kode54
- Added pattern delay/loop checking to pattern silence checker
- Silent pattern trimmer now trims only patterns which also contain delays/loops
- Trimmer also produces a single-row empty pattern instead of a 0-row pattern, which would hang

2004-09-21 21:44 UTC - kode54
- Fixed MOD 8xx effect scale

2004-09-21 00:55 UTC - kode54
- Initialize sample variables to zero for MOD/XM files with retrigger commands before any actual note data
- Changed global volume cutoff to try the callback every 5 seconds of global silence
- Changed resampler to assume todo values less than zero are actually integer overflow, which works fine for
  portamento to really low pitch levels. It should never be negative anyway.
- Version is now 0.9.2.10.1

2004-09-19 15:31 UTC - kode54
- S3M reader now disposes of effects unsupported by Scream Tracker 3. Some people are just too l33t to
  use the effects column only for effects.
- Swapped PTM portamento effect directions. Whoever wrote PTMFORM.DOC must have been on drugs or something.
- Corrected MOD/S3M (PTM?) behavior when the sample is changed on a playing channel without a new note
- Version is now 0.9.2.10

2004-09-18 01:10 UTC - kode54
- Corrected speed change command so it only calls speed zero callback on XM files and not MOD files
- Version is now 0.9.2.9

2004-09-17 23:43 UTC - kode54

- Implemented IT panbrello effect, hopefully

2004-09-17 09:18 UTC - kode54
- Implemented S3M Xxx panning bug for surround modes
- Added OKT extension, since it is handled by the MOD reader

2004-09-16 11:54 UTC - kode54
- Fixed S3M panning command. Others probably need proper translation as well.
- Version is now 0.9.2.8.2

2004-09-16 11:34 UTC - kode54
- Lovely, had to fix loop checking behavior when parsing through an empty pattern with no event list
- Fixed seek() to invoke open2() properly, whoops.

2004-09-16 09:46 UTC - kode54
- CRIKEY! Broke pattern loops on formats other than XM! Fixed now.
- Version is now 0.9.2.8.1

2004-09-16 06:26 UTC - kode54

2004-09-15 20:46 UTC - kode54
- Added optional silence trimming

2004-09-15 20:41 UTC - kode54

- Added a zero global volume callback for other annoying modules

2004-09-14 04:57 UTC - kode54
- Added change starting order context menu item
- Version is now 0.9.2.7

2004-09-13 22:14 UTC - kode54
- Fixed loop end point for PTM files

2004-09-13 19:53 UTC - kode54
- Fixed sample offset effect for PTM files

2004-09-13 15:30 UTC - kode54

2001-09-09 14:25  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/render.c: 8-bit bug fixed, but the code
	hasn't been tested yet.

2001-09-09 13:07  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/play.c, src/render.c: Rendering and audio
	stream playing are now separated into levels.  The rendering level
	is available in dumb.h.  I've removed Bob's changes, so I hope it
	won't set him back too much :)

2001-09-08 20:23  joe_programmer

	support.

2001-09-05 19:16  entheh

	D'oh! :)

2001-09-05 17:37  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Volume envelopes working properly now, and stereo
	panning bug fixed.

2001-09-05 11:10  entheh

	* src/play.c, tools/cit.c: Volume envelopes... bleargh, zasx.duh

	* include/dumb.h, src/combine.c, src/main.c, src/sterpan.c,
	tools/cit.c: Stereo sound now works, finally! Not all stereo stuff
	is implemented though, and it'll suffer from the same bug as the
	volume (see the citbugs.txt file).

2001-09-02 19:34  entheh

	* examples/playduh.c, include/dumb.h, src/combine.c, src/getsig.c,
	src/main.c, src/play.c, src/sample.c, src/sequence.c: COMB signal
	implemented. This will allow two mono signals to be combined into a
	stereo one. SPAN (panning), and modifications to cit.c, still to do
	before any stereo sound will be heard.

2001-08-24 19:01  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/getsig.c, src/play.c, src/resample.c,
	src/sample.c, src/sequence.c: Support for multiple channels has
	been added. Adding stereo sound support should be a breeze now, but
	that'll have to wait for another day.

2001-08-24 14:17  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, tools/cit.c, tools/citbugs.txt: Dunno what this
	commit is, but it seems it should've been done a long time ago :)

2001-08-17 18:25  entheh

	* docs/duhspecs.txt, src/sequence.c, tools/cit.c: A new compression
	system is in use for the sequences. WARNING: OLDER DUH FILES WILL
	CAUSE A CRASH. This is the price you pay for using a version of
	DUMB prior to the first release :)

2001-08-17 12:25  joe_programmer

	* docs/duhspecs.txt: Proposal for new smaller format

2001-08-14 04:32  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: cit.c has been revamped somewhat. It's a hell of a
	lot uglier, and has lost some features. However, it is supposedly
	more faithful to the IT standard.  Thank goodness the IT converter
	is not to be the central attraction :-)

2001-08-13 12:36  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: cit.c now loads everything in the IT file. It has
	been adapted to support everything described in the ittech.txt file
	that comes with Impulse Tracker 2.14. However, the conversion is
	still as awful as ever :-)

2001-08-11 22:40  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Some of the "Damn, I need more information"-style
	comments in cit.c have been replaced with information on what the

2001-08-10 21:30  entheh

	* examples/playduh.c: allegro_exit()/allegro_message() bug
	partially fixed in playduh.c.  Still problems in case of usage(),
	and failure on allegro_init().

2001-08-10 20:07  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/getsig.c, src/sequence.c: Removed the
	MAX_SAMPLES limitation. STREAM_SIZE can be increased now.

2001-08-10 19:31  entheh

2001-08-06 18:06  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/resample.c, src/sample.c, tools/cit.c:
	Resampling code is in a separate file, and extensive comments have
	been written for it. cit.c has very limited volume support now.

2001-08-05 10:18  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: A check in cit.c has gone from ASSERT to if :-)

2001-08-03 23:23  joe_programmer

	src/play.c, src/register.c, src/sample.c, src/sequence.c,
	tools/cit.c: CIT (IT Compiler) working, just about. Tut tut, such a
	name, so suggestive of monopolistic intentions... But anyway, the
	new ASCII art and credits are at the top of every file!

2001-08-03 11:46  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: cit.c added. Currently unchanged from Bob's IT
	loader, except that the header files have been hard-included, and
	it now compiles as C rather than C++. Oh, and check out the new
	ASCII art :-)

2001-08-02 17:49  entheh

	* src/sample.c: Changes to the sample signal so that no special
	case is required at the end of a sample when resampling.

2001-08-02 14:33  joe_programmer
