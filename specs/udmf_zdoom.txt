===============================================================================

This document discusses only the additions ZDoom makes to the UDMF 
specification.

=======================================
I. Grammar / Syntax
=======================================

    No changes.

=======================================
II. Implementation Semantics
=======================================

------------------------------------
II.A : Storage and Retrieval of Data
------------------------------------

Any TEXTMAP lump in the described namespaces must be encoded in either ISO 8859-1, Windows-1252 or UTF-8
with UTF-8 being the recommended encoding.

-----------------------------------
II.B : Storage Within Archive Files
-----------------------------------

In addition to the base specification ZDoom recognizes the following lumps
between the TEXTMAP and ENDMAP lumps:

    BEHAVIOR = contains compiled ACS code
    DIALOGUE = contains compiled Strife or USDF conversation scripts.
    ZNODES = Nodes (must be stored as extended GL nodes. Compression is allowed
                    but deprecated for portability reasons.)
    BLOCKMAP = blockmap. It is recommended not to include this lump in UDMF maps.
    REJECT = reject table. Recommended use is for special effects only.
    
    Lumps starting with 'SCRIPT' are guaranteed to be ignored by ZDoom so they
    can be used to store ACS and dialogue script sources.
    
--------------------------------
II.C : Implementation Dependence
--------------------------------

ZDoom supports all namespaces defined in the base specification and adds two new
ones:
    "ZDoom"
    "ZDoomTranslated"
    
The only difference between these two namespaces is how line, thing and sector
specials are handled:

'ZDoom' uses Hexen type specials which are ZDoom's native implementation.

'ZDoomTranslated' uses Doom-type specials. Such maps have to be processed by
a special translator. A special translator is a text lump that defines how
Doom-format specials are translated into Hexen-format specials. By default
each game defines its own translation table but these can be overridden in
MAPINFO. It is the mapper's responsibility to choose the correct translation
table for a map.


=======================================
III. Standardized Fields
=======================================

ZDoom's namespaces implement all fields from the standard, regardless of
any restrictions mentioned in the spec.
In particular, the 'ZDoomTranslated' namespaces implements thing specials.
These will ignore the implicit trigger type and triggering semantics are the
same as for native maps.
The only field not fully supported is the thing's 'friend' field. ZDoom does
not offer MBF's friendly monster implementation and will remap any use of this
field to 'strifeally', even for the 'Doom' namespace.

In addition to the standard fields, ZDoom defines the following:
Note: All <bool> fields default to false unless mentioned otherwise.

   vertex
   {
      zfloor = <float>;         // Floor height at this vertex. Only applies to triangular sectors
      zceiling = <float>;       // Ceiling height at this vertex. Only applies to triangular sectors
   }

   linedef
   {
      alpha = <float>;            // Translucency of this line, default is 1.0
      renderstyle = <string>;     // Render style, can be "translucent" or "add",
                                  // default is "translucent".

      monsteractivate = <bool>;   // Monsters can trigger this line.
                                  // For compatibility only because this flag's

      * Note about arg0str

      For lines with ACS specials (80-86 and 226), if arg0str is present and non-null, it
      will be used as the name of the script to execute, and arg0 will be ignored.

      * Note about dropactors

      The spec requires this to be false by default. Currently, however, ZDoom assumes this to be true
      for Doom format maps so any map converter converting to the ZDoomTranslated namespace should
      set this flag for each tagged sector.

      * Note about arg0str

      For things with ACS specials (80-86 and 226), if arg0str is present and non-null, it
      will be used as the name of the script to execute, and arg0 will be ignored.
      On dynamic lights, arg0str can be used to set a color by name, this will supersede all args which are normally used to define a color.
   }



*** Special notes for map format conversions:

   Setting the line's ID via special is not supported so any special using
   this option must be converted to use the line's ID field instead.
   Unless mentioned differently the arg being used to define the line ID
   should be set to 0.
   The following line specials are affected:

   121: Line_SetIdentification, arg 0
   208: TranslucentLine, arg0 (arg0 must be preserved)
     1: Polyobj_StartLine, arg3
     5: Polyobj_ExplicitLine, arg4
   181: Plane_Align, arg2
   215: Teleport_Line, arg0
   222: Scroll_Texture_Model, arg0 (arg0 must be preserved)
   160: Sector_3DFloor, arg4 (both uses as high-byte of tag and line ID are not supported in UDMF and must be remapped)

   Some specials also allow setting the extended flags. These must also be
   converted to explicitly setting the flags through the defined map fields.
   This affects the following specials:

   121: Line_SetIdentification, arg1
   208: TranslucentLine, arg3

   These args are to be converted as follows to flags, bit by bit:

   Bit 0 (Value   1): zoneboundary
   Bit 1 (Value   2): jumpover
   Bit 2 (Value   4): blockfloaters
   Bit 3 (Value   8): clipmidtex
   Bit 4 (Value  16): wrapmidtex
   Bit 5 (Value  32): midtex3d
   Bit 6 (Value  64): checkswitchrange
   Bit 7 (Value 128): firstsideonly
   When used in special 208 this arg should be cleared afterward.

   Special 121 is not being used by UDMF maps in ZDoom and should be completely
   deleted after conversion.
