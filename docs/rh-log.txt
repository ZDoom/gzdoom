April 17, 2009
- Gave the intermission screen sounds their own SNDINFO entries.

April 16, 2009
- Removed obsolete snd_surround cvar.

April 15, 2009
- Changing screen resolution now adjusts the automap scale to be constant
  relative to screen resolution.
- Fixed: When FMultiPatchTexture::MakeTexture() needed to work in RGB
  colorspace, it didn't zero out the temporary buffer.
- Fixed memory leak from leftover code for 7z loading and added the
  LUMPF_ZIPFILE flag to their contents so they have the same semantics
  as zips.

April 14, 2009
- Added support for 7z archives.

April 13, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added -noautoload option.
- Added default Raven automap colors set. Needs to be tested because I can't
  compare against the DOS version myself.
- Extened A_PlaySound and A_StopSound to be able to set all parameters of the
  internal sound code.

April 13, 2009
- Changed gravity doubling so that it only happens when you run off a ledge.

April 10, 2009
- Fixed: World panning was ignored for the X offset of masked midtextures.

April 10, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Extended MF5_MOVEWITHSECTOR so that it always keeps the actor on the ground
  of a moving floor, regardless of movement speed. For NOBLOCKMAP items this
  is necessary because otherwise they can be left in the air and it also adds 
  some options for other things.

April 9, 2009
- Changed A_FreezeDeathChunks() so that instead of directly destroying an
  actor, it sets it to the "Null" state, which will make it invisible and
  destroy it one tic later.
- Added a NULL pointer check to A_Fire() and copied the target to a local
  variable inside A_VileAttack() so that if P_DamageMobj() destroys the
  target, the function will still have a valid pointer to it (since reading
  it from the actor's instance data invokes the read barrier, which would
  return NULL).

April 9, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added NOBLOCKMAP/MOVEWITHSECTOR combination to a few items that had their
  NOBLOCKMAP flag taken away previously to make them move with a sector.
  This should fix the performance problem Claustrophobia had with recent
  ZDoom versions.

April 8, 2009
- Added MF5_MOVEWITHSECTOR flag, so you can have the benefits of MF_NOBLOCKMAP
  but still have actors that will move up and down with the floor. IceChunk
  now uses both of these flags.
- Performance optimization for FBlockThingsIterator::Next(): Actors that
  exist in only one block don't need to be added to the CheckArray or
  scanned for in it. Also changed the array used to keep track of visited
  actors into a hash table.

April 7, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added some default definitions for constants that may miss in some headers.
- replaced __va_copy with va_copy per Chris's suggestion.
- replaced #include <malloc.h> with #include <stdlib.h> where possible.

April 6, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The UDMF textmap readbuffer was never freed.

April 4, 2009
- Fixed: GetPlayerInput() died if you tried to get the input of the activator
  and the activator was the world.

April 4, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: Any player class inheriting directly from PlayerPawn was left with
  empty weapon slots due to the recent rewrite of the weapon slot assignment
  code. To handle such classes each game now defines a default weapon slot
  setting in its gameinfo. This will be used when a player class without any
  weapon slot settings is used.
- added 'damage' to the actor variables exported to DECORATE's expression
  evaluator.
- fixed: solid corpses could block ripper missile that originally killed them.

April 2, 2009
- Fixed: Doom's status bar was lacking its default face.
- Fixed: Custom skin face graphics were not added to the texture manager.
- Fixed: UseHealthItems() gave you health equal to the number of items in
  the stack of health items, rather than the item's proper amount.

April 1, 2008
- Fixed: SBARINFO's "usessecondaryammo" considered a weapon to not use
  secondaryammo if ammo2's type was the same as ammo1's, but only if you
  didn't use the "not" keyword with it.

March 29, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Altering a link type with Sector_SetLink did not work.
- Fixed: player.crouchsprite had no proper means of unsetting the crouch
  sprite which is needed by the ChexPlayer.
- Fixed: A_ChangeFlags must unlink the actor from the world before changing
  the NOBLOCKMAP and NOSECTOR flags.

March 28, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Dehacked string replacement did not check the clusters' finaleflats.
- Changed the definition of several typedef'd structs so that they are
  properly named.
- Limited DEHSUPP lump lookup to search zdoom.pk3 only. It will no longer
  be possible to load DEHSUPP lumps from user WADs.
- Brought back the text-based DEHSUPP parser and changed it to be able to 
  reference states by label. Also changed label names of 
  DoomUnusedStates and added proper labels to all states that were
  previously forced to be the first state of an actor so that the old
  (limited) method could access them. This was done to address the following
  bug:
- Fixed: The player's death states calling A_PlayerSkinCheck should not be
  part of the state set that is accessible by Dehacked. These will produce
  error messages when mapped to non-players.

March 27, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Reading the RNG states from a savegame calculated the amounts of
  RNGs in the savegame wrong.

March 26, 2009
- Changed random seed initialization so that it uses the system's
  cryptographically secure random number generator, if available, instead
  of the current time.
- Changed the random number generator from Lee Killough's algorithm to the
  SFMT607 variant of the Mersenne Twister.
  <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html>

March 25, 2009
- Made fmodex.dll delay-loaded so the game should be runnable on Windows 95
  again, though without sound.
- Changed gameinfo_t and gameborder_t to be named structs instead of
  typedef'ed anonymous structs.
- Fixed: P_AutoUseHealth() used autousemodes 0 and 1 instead of 1 and 2.
- Fixed: SBARINFO did not recognize 5:4 aspect ratio.
- Fixed: screenshot_dir was ignored.

March 25, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed some obsolete code from G_InitLevelLocals that was causing problems
  with maps that have no name.
- Fixed: The inner loop in AWeaponSlot::PickWeapon could endlessly loop when
  the counter variable became negative.
- Fixed: Implicitly defined clusters were not initialized when being created.

March 24, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Item tossing did not work anymore.

March 23, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: Making the gameinfo customizable by MAPINFO requires different
  checks for map specific border flats.

March 22, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- removed gamemission variable because it wasn't used anywhere.
- removed gamemode variable. All it was used for were some checks that
  really should depend on GI_MAPxx.
- Externalized all internal gameinfo definitions.
- added include to MAPINFO parser.
- split IWAD detection code off from d_main.cpp into its own file.
- disabled gamemission based switch filtering because it is not useful.
- added GAMEINFO submission by Blzut3 with significant modifications. There
  is no GAMEINFO lump. Instead all information is placed in MAPINFO, except
  the data that is needed to decide which WADs to autoload.

March 19, 2009
- Added the current value of the string buffer to the state saved when
  making a function call in ACS. Now you can print inside functions and
  also return values from them for the caller to plug directly into
  another string without having to save it to a temporary variable.
- Added an OutputVolume() call after the MusicVolumeChanged() call in
  MIDIStreamer::Play(). Since the state isn't playing yet when
  MusicVolumeChanged() is called, it doesn't do this itself.
- Fixed: P_RailAttack() passed the wrong angle variable to P_TraceBleed().

March 18, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: S_StopSound may not assume that after stopping a sound channel
  its link to the next item in the list is still valid.
- Fixed typo in src/CMakeLists.txt.
- Fixed: Armor only worked for players.
- Fixed: P_FindFloorCeiling may not call P_PointInSector if called from
  P_SpawnMapThing. It must use the values the actor has been initialized to
  by LinkToWorldForMapThing.

March 17, 2009
- Added the -norun parameter to quit the game just before video
  initialization. To be used to check for errors in scripts without actually
  running the game.
- Added the -stdout parameter to the Windows version to send all output to
  a console, like the Linux version has done all along.

March 16, 2009
- Added support for loading ZGL2 nodes. (Only useful with UDMF and maps with
  more than 65534 lines.)

March 15, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: AWeapon::PickupForAmmo accessed ammo type 1 when checking ammo type2.

March 14, 2009
- Changed Linux default for fullscreen to false.
- Removed CVAR_SERVERINFO flag from compatmode. Since it writes to
  compatflags, that should be enough. Having that flag set for both of
  them leads to problems with e.g. loading a savegame, where compatflags is
  restored, then compatmode is restored and it completely undoes whatever
  compatflags was restored to.
- Fixed: Trying to start a map for some single file that isn't really a map
  caused a crash.

March 12, 2009
- Fixed: After loading a savegame or unmorphing, a player's weapon slots
  were empty.

March 11, 2009
- Moved weapon slot initialization into APlayerPawn::PostBeginPlay() so that
  they can be initialized when players respawn in multiplayer.

March 11, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a Check for the Vavoom namespace to the UDMF parser. Functionally
  it's 100% identical with ZDoom's own but needs to be checked for in
  case Vavoom compatible UDMF maps are released.

March 10, 2009
- Added an SDL output plugin, so FMOD can produce sound using SDL's audio
  support instead of its own OSS/ALSA/ESD support. This is selectable by
  setting snd_output to "sdl".
- Fixed: On Linux systems with ALSA but no OSS support, trying to start
  the sound system with snd_output "default" would fail instead of trying
  to use ALSA.
- Added sdl_nokeyrepeat to disable key repeating in the menus and console
  on Linux.
- Added support for zip/pk3 files with LZMA and bzip2 compression to ZDoom.
- Added more output to zipdir and a -q option to turn it off.
- Added -u option to zipdir to only recompress those files in a zip that have
  changed. 

March 7, 2009
- Added -d and -f options to zipdir. -d forces deflate compression, and -f
  forces a write of the zip, even if it's newer than all the files it contains.

March 7, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: P_CompleteWeaponSetup was missing a NULL pointer check for the player.
- Adjusted some gravity related thresholds for the fix from Feb 28. Also removed
  some unnecessary floating point math from this code.

March 6, 2009
- Added support for bzip2 and LZMA compression to zipdir.

March 6, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Hirogen2's patch for unlimited ammo CVAR.

March 4, 2009
- Fixed: You couldn't easily play with the compatibility options menu during
  the title screen, because the demo loop reset the server cvars after each
  attempt to play a demo, even though the demos never actually played. The
  proper long-term solution would be to make shadow copies of all cvars
  touched by demos and use those for the demo and the real things for
  everything else, but this should do for now and is a lot easier.
- Fixed: When using BOOM-style sector flags and specials together, the
  special was ignored unless it was "secret".
- Fixed: One byte is too short for DUMB_IT_SIGRENDERER to store song tempo.
  Changed it to a word.
- Went back to using RDTSC for timing on Win32. Ironically,
  QueryPerformanceCounter() is obviously using the TSC for its timing on my
  machine, yet the overhead it has to do to keep the timer sane is apparently
  noticeable on a few maps. I suppose I should at some time check
  clock_gettime() and see if it has similar issues on Linux.

March 3, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- changed: If a monster with the BOSSDEATH flag is crushed A_BossDeath will
  be called now.
- fixed: D'Sparil's second form was missing the BOSSDEATH flag.
- fixed: D'Sparil's first form requires the DONTGIB flag.
- fixed: Heretic doesn't crush monsters. To handle this in a more generic
  fashion this depends on the presence of a gib sprite now.

March 1, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed burn and Acolyte death sequences so that they leave corpses that
  don't vanish.
- Fixed: AActor::SetOrigin must call P_FindFloorCeiling to get the true
  floor and ceiling heights. Otherwise the actor will fall right through
  3DMidtex textures (and 3D-floors.)

February 29, 2008
- Version bump to 2.3.0.

February 28, 2009
- Fixed: The TeleporterBeacon tried to enter its See state rather than its
  Drop state. Also changed it to fade out when it's done rather than
  disappearing abruptly.

February 28, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Strife's quest based line actions also work in Deathmatch.
- Fixed: Gravity application was not correct. For actors with no vertical 
  momentum the initial pull is supposed to be twice as strong as when 
  vertical movement already takes place.
- added invquery CCMD like in Strife. Also removed all underscores from the
  tag strings so that they can be printed properly.
- Fixed: Skill baby was missing 'autousehealth' for all games.
- Added a new CVAR: sv_disableautohealth
- Autouse of health items is no longer hardwired to the default item classes. 
  There's a new property HealthPickup.Autouse. 0 means no autouse, 1 a small 
  Raven health item, 2 a large Raven health item and 3 a Strife item.

February 26, 2009
- Removed an early-out in wallscan_striped() that is invalid when drawing a
  skybox.

February 25, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: nextmap and nextsecret CCMDs set skill to 0.
- fixed: level.flags2 was not stored in savegames. Also bumped min. savegame
  version and removed old compatibility handlings.

February 25, 2009
- The SFX Reverb unit is now moved so that it serves as an input to the water
  effect rather than as an input to the ChannelGroup Target Unit. This means
  the water effect is now applied after any room reverb, rather than in
  parallel with it.
- Fixed: UI sounds should not have reverb applied to them.
- Removed the delay for starting all sounds from one tic at exactly the same
  DSP position. Without also synchronizing the stopping of sounds, it can
  cause problems with things like the chainsaw where the sound is stopped and
  immediately restarted, causing occassional gaps between the stopping of the
  sound and the starting of the new one. (I added the start synchronization to
  combat flanging of paired moving polyobjects when moving around, but I think
  just removing velocity from the player for sound calculations takes care of
  that well enough.)

February 24, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added GCC headers for intptr_t to tarray.h.
- Added MF5_PAINLESS flag for projectiles that don't make the target go into
  the pain state.

February 23, 2009
- Changed DEM_ADDSLOTDEFAULT, DEM_ADDSLOT, and DEM_SETSLOT to be more space-
  efficient.
- Fixed: player->oldbuttons was copied from the current button set at the end
  of P_PlayerThink(), well before ACS could ever get at it with GetPlayerInput.

February 23, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The map name display on the automap was incomplete.
- Added FakeInventory.Respawns DECORATe property
- Fixed: Unsetting the MF5_INCONVERSATION flag did not work when quitting the
  conversation by pressing Escape.

February 22, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added ML_BLOCKPROJECTILE flag to lines.
- Fixed: With opl_onechip set the second OPL chip was never set to anything valid
  so it contained an invalid pointer. There were also a few other places that
  simply assumed that the second chip is set to something valid.
- Fixed: NPCs which are engaged in a conversation should not move.
- Fixed: Player movement animation was not stopped when starting a conversation.

February 21, 2009
- Added selective compression of network packets. Interestingly, most packets
  don't actually compress all that well, even the ones that aren't too short
  to possibly compress. (Maybe make the whole thing one long, never-ending
  zlib data stream with Z_SYNC_FLUSH used to chunk things at packet
  boundaries? That would probably help the compression ratio, but it would
  require changing the way the netcode determines sequence, which would be
  a much more invasive change.)

February 21, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Heretic's fullscreen HUD crashed when the player had armor without
  a valid icon.
- Fixed: The StrifePlayer was missing a RunHealth setting.
- Fixed: Untranslated colors in fonts had an alpha value of 0 but need 255.
- Fixed: The Doom status bar's ammo display may not use the INDEXFONT for 
  the alternative HUD. Instead it has to create a separate one out of the
  STYSNUM characters.
- Fixed: skins can not be sorted for binary search because the player class
  code depends on the original indices.
- Fixed: P_StartConversation set the global dialog node variable for all
  players, not just the consoleplayer.
- Fixed: AWeapon::PickupForAmmo assumed that any weapon having a secondary
  ammo type also has a primary one.

February 20, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Bumped netgame, demo and min demo version for the weapon slot changes.
- changed weapon slots to be stored per player. Information is now transmitted
  across the network so that all machines know each player's current weapon
  configuration so that it can be used by cheats or HUD display routines.
- fixed: level_info_t::mapbg was not initialized

February 17, 2009
- Fixed: Player names and chat macros that end with incomplete \c escapes now
  have those escapes stripped before printing so that they do not merge with
  subsequent text.

February 15, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The CHARFORMAT structure that is used to set the color in a Windows
  Rich Edit control was not fully initialized resulting in incorrect colors
  being set.

Feburary 14, 2009
- Moved default weapon slot assignments into the player classes.
  Weapon.SlotNumber is now used solely for mods that want to add new weapons
  without completely redoing the player's arsenal. Restored some config-based
  weapon slot customization, though slots are no longer automatically saved
  to the config and section names have changed slightly. However, unlike
  before, config slots are now the definitive word on slot assignments and
  cannot be overridden by any other files loaded.

February 14, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added MF5_CANTSEEK flag to prevent seeker missiles from homing in on
  certain actors and added an option to APowerInvisibility to set this
  flag when active.
- Added map specific automap backgrounds.
- Fixed: Voodoo dolls did not play a sound when dying.
- Added colorized error messages to DECORATE and made a few more error
  conditions that do not block further parsing not immediately abort.
- Made all errors in CreateNewActor not immediately fatal so that the
  rest of the DECORATE lump can be parsed normally to look for more errors.
- Fixed: Defining classes with the same name as their immediate base class
  was legal. It should not be allowed that a class has another one with the
  same name in its ancestry.
- Fixed: Formatting of the intermission screen on Heretic, Hexen and Strife
  was broken. Changed it to use WI_Drawpercent which does it properly and
  also allows showing percentage in these games now.
- Fixed: The MAPINFO parser ignored missing terminating braces of the last
  block in the file.

February 11, 2009
- Fixed: Several weapons were missing a game filter from their definitions.
- Removed storage of weapon slots in the config so that weapon slots can
  be setup in the weapons themselves. Slots are still configurable, since
  they need to be for KEYCONF to work; any changes simply won't be saved
  when you quit.
- Removed limit on weapon slot sizes.

February 10, 2009
- Fixed: DirectInput8Create() used the wrong calling convention.
- Moved the V_InitFontColors() call earlier in the startup sequence so that
  colored error messages appear colored in the startup window. Also lightened
  up the "Flat" red to contrast better on the startup background.

February 9, 2009
- Changed I_InitInput() to acquire the IDirectInput8A interface by using
  DirectInput8Create() instead of CoCreateInstance(). This allows the Steam
  GameOverlayRenderer.dll to properly hook it.
- Stopped sending double the number of wheel events as appropriate to the
  console under Linux.
- Added middle mouse button selection pasting for X systems.

February 8, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed parsing of 'cluster' keyword when format is not yet known.
- Moved CheckCompatibility call so that it is done after setting LEVEL_HEXENFORMAT.
- Fixed parsing for MustConfirm key in skill parser.
- Converted internal MAPINFOs to new syntax.
- Added a range parameter to SNDINFO's $limit.
- Restored Dehacked music name replacement.

February 7, 2009
- Added GUICapture mouse button events for Win32.
- Changed I_GetFromClipboard() to return an FString.
- Added GTK+-based clipboard support for Linux.
- Fixed: Most Linux filesystems do not fill in d_type for scandir(), so we
  cannot rely on it to detect directories.
- Added NicePath() function to perform shell-style ~ substitution on path
  names.
- Changed the default screenshot directory on Unix to ~/.zdoom/screenshots/.
- Added -shotdir command line option to temporarily override the
  screenshot_dir cvar.

February 7, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: G_SerializeLevel must use the TEXMAN_ReturnFirst flag for getting
  the sky textures so that it still works when the first texture in a TEXTURE1
  lump is used as sky.

February 6, 2009
- Restored the old drawseg/sprite distance check from 2.0.63. The code that
  replaced it did the check at the center of the area intersected by the
  sprite and the drawseg, whereas 2.0.63 only did the check at the location
  of the sprite on the map.
- Commented out the CALL_ACTION(A_Look, actor) for targetless friendly
  monsters in A_DoChase(). They can still find new targets without this,
  and with it, they got stuck on the first frame of their see state.
- Fixed: Keys bound in a custom key section would unbind the key in the
  main game section.
- Fixed scrolling of the automap background on a rotated automap.

February 5, 2009
- Changed singleplayer allowrespawn to act like a co-op game when you
  change levels while dead by immediately respawning you before the switch
  so that you get to keep all your inventory.
- Fixed: G_InitLevelLocals() did not set flags2.

February 5, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: The compatibility parser applied the last map's settings to all
  maps in the compatibility list.
- Added compatibility settings for a few more levels in some classic WADs.
- Added spechit overflow workaround for Strain MAP07. This is highly map
  specific because the original behavior cannot be restored.
- Added a check for Doom's IWAD levels that forces COMPAT_SHORTTEX for them.
  MD5 cannot be used well here because there's many different IWADs with 
  slightly different levels. This is only done for Doom format levels to
  ensure that custom IWADs for ZDoom are not affected.
- fixed: level.flags2 was not reset at level start.
- Fixed: Morph powerups can change the actor picking up the item so 
  AInventory::CallTryPickup must be able to return the new actor.
- Fixed: ACS's GiveInventory may not assume that a PlayerPawn is still
  attached to the player data after an item has been given.
- Added a missing NULL pointer check to DBaseStatusBar::Blendview.

February 4, 2009
- Added a compatibility lump because I think it's a shame that Void doesn't
  work properly on new ZDooms after all the collaboration I had with Cyb on
  that map. (Works with other maps, too.)

February 4, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Made improvements so that the FOptionalMapinfoData class is easier to use.

February 3, 2009
- Moved the MF_INCHASE recursion check from A_Look() into A_Chase(). This
  lets A_Look() always put the actor into its see state. This problem could
  be heard by an Archvile's resurrectee playing its see sound but failing to
  enter its see state because it was called from A_Chase().
- Fixed: SBARINFO used different rounding modes for the background and
  foreground of the DrawBar command.
- Bumped MINSAVEVER to coincide with the new MAPINFO merge.
- Added a fflush() call after the logfile write in I_FatalError so that the
  error text is visible in the file while the error dialog is displayed.

January 18, 2009 - February 3, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- moved all code related to global ACS variables to p_acs.cpp where it belongs.
- fixed: The nextmap and nextsecret CCMDs need to call G_DeferedInitNew instead of G_InitNew.
- rewrote the MAPINFO parser:
  * split level_info_t::flags into 2 DWORDS so that I don't have to deal with 64 bit values later.
  * split off skill code into its own file
  * created a parser class for MAPINFO
  * replaced all uses of ReplaceString in level_info_t with FStrings and made the specialaction 
    data a TArray so that levelinfos can be handled without error prone maintenance functions.
  * split of parser code from g_level.cpp
  * const-ified parameters to F_StartFinale.
  * Changed how G_MaybeLookupLevelName works and made it return an FString.
  * removed 64 character limit on level names.

February 2, 2009
- Changed DECORATE replacements so that they aren't overridden by Dehacked.

February 2, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The damage factor for 'normal' damage is supposed to be applied to
  all damage types that don't have a specific damage factor.

January 31, 2009
- Changed FMOD init() to allocate some virtual channels.
- Fixed clipping in D3DFB::DrawTextureV() for good by using a scissor test.

January 30, 2009
- Fixed: D3DFB::DrawTextureV() did not properly adjust the texture coordinate
  for lclip and rclip.
- Added weapdrop ccmd.
- Centered the compatibility mode option in the comptibility options menu.
- Added button mappings for 8 mouse buttons on SDL. It works with my system,
  but Linux being Linux, there are no guarantees that it's appropriate for
  other systems.
- Fixed: SDL input code did not generate GUI events for the mousewheel, so it
  could not be used to scroll the console buffer.

January 30, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Blzut3's statusbar maintenance patch.

January 29, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed sound origin of the Mage Wand's missile.

January 28, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added APROP_Dropped actor property.
- Fixed: The compatmode CVAR needs CVAR_NOINITCALL so that the compatibility 
  flags don't get reset each start.
- Fixed: compatmode Doom(strict) was missing COMPAT_CROSSDROPOFF
  
January 27, 2009
- More GCC warning removal, the most egregious of which was the security
  vulnerability "format not a string literal and no format arguments".
- Changed the CMake script to search for fmod libraries by full name instead
  of assuming a symbolic link has been placed for the latest version. It can
  also find a non-installed copy of FMOD if it is placed local to the ZDoom
  source tree.

January 26, 2009
- Fixed: Some OPL state needs to be restored before calculating rhythm. Also,
  since only the rhythm section uses the RNG, it doesn't need to be advanced
  for the normal voice processing.

January 25, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed some issues with P_FindFloorCeiling's coordinate processing.
- added a new compatmode CVAR which allows setting some generic compatibility 
  flag combinations:
  Doom: sets the options needed to make most Doom.exe compatible map play without
  errors.
  Doom (strict): Same as above but sets a few more options. Please note that this
  does not mean full Doom.exe behavior emulation.
  Boom: Sets all options that consider differences between ZDoom and Boom.
  ZDoom 2.0.63: Sets only the COMPATF_SOUNDTARGET option which is needed for
  many older ZDoom maps.
- added new COMPAT_CROSSDROPOFF option to block monsters from being pushed over
  dropoffs by damage kickback.
- fixed: AFastProjectile::Tick must call Effect only 8 times per tic, regardless
  of the amount of steps taken.
- fixed: momentum checks in AFastProjectile did not use absolute values.

January 24, 2009
- Restored the rhythm section to fmopl.cpp and made some slight updates from
  version 0.72 of MAME's fmopl.c. Also refactored CalcVoice so that the
  original MAME structure is more visible.
- Removed the SoundChans bitfield from AActor, since it seems there are race
  conditions I don't fully understand where it simply doesn't work.
- Removed BaseTime initialization from sdl/i_system.cpp as per Chris's
  recommendation.

January 24, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The sight checking code didn't initialize the myseethrough variable.
- Fixed: With COMPAT_TRACE switched on linedef actions on lines having
  the same sector on both sides were not triggered.

January 23, 2009
- Set packet server as the default for four or more player games, and also the
  default for three player games where the other players are not in the same
  private IP range.

January 18, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a CopyInfo function to FTexture that contains all code required to 
  clone a texture. Used for creating warping textures.
- Fixed: P_FindFloorCeiling should not be called before setting the actor's z-
  coordinate. For testing 3D Midtex lines and 3D floors the proper position
  needs to be set first.
- Fixed the autoaim fix from Jan 10.

January 11, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added option to specify the amount of ammo to be given by a WeaponGiver.

January 10, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: Identification of Doom1 Freedoom IWAD did not work.
- fixed: UDMF did not initialize a sector's light colors.
- fixed implementation of DF2_NOAUTOAIM flag.

January 7, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- copied some 3D floor fixes from GZDoom.
- fixed: Crushing polyobject did incomplete checks for blocked moves.

January 5, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: Parsing of color strings with 6 characters and spaces did not work.
- fixed: State labels must be evaluated for the state's owner, not the calling actor.

January 4, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: For map spawns any change to an actor's floor z-coordinate must be 
  delayed until after its z-coordinate has been set. That means that for 
  map spawns AActor::StaticSpawn may not call P_FindFloorCeiling for such
  actors.
- added GZDoom's 3D floor physics code. This is not active yet so anything
  compiled from this code won't have any support for it!
- Used new functionality to avoid moving the puff around in SpawnDeepSplash.
- Fixed: P_RailAttack used the shooting actor or a default puff for some splash
  related actions. It should use the puff type passed to it as a parameter instead.
- Changed splash handling in P_LineAttack to use the actual hit position to
  spawn the splash and not the puff's spawn position which is offset a little.
- made some precision related changes to P_HitWater. The precise hit coordinate
  can now be passed as parameters.

January 3, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Made spawning of floor- and ceiling huggers a little more intelligent.
- Fixed: 'None' was no longer recognized as a NULL class name by the 
  DECORATE parser.

January 1, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added 'ininventory item, amount' option to SBARINFO to check for a minimum 
  amount instead of mere presence in the inventory.
- Fixed: Door lock messages were overwritten by remote messages.

January 1, 2009  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: SBARINFO used GetSpecies instead of GetClass to check weapon types.
- Added a few missing NULL pointer checks to SBARINFO code.
- Changed pickup sounds of local player to unpaused to resolve problems with 
  the time freezer and make them behave better.
- Fixed: When sounds are paused not all newly started sounds should actually
  be played.
- Fixed: SBARINFO had no means to check if a weapon uses any ammo at all and
  as a result the inventory icon was misplaced if a no-ammo weapon was selected.

December 31, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: P_CheckMissileSpawn and AFastProjectile didn't adjust their
  calculations for missiles with small radii.
- Added a new aiming mode to A_CustomRailgun to aim directly at the target
  from the actual point the shot originates from.
- Added a constant name for Skulltag's 128 flag for A_SpawnItemEx. For 
  compatibility ZDoom needs to define this name, too, even though it doesn't 
  use it.
- Fixed: The nodebuilder could hang on badly set up polyobjects. Now it aborts 
  when the loop iterates NumberOfSegs times.
  
December 30, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: FMOD calls for setting the water reverb must check the return code
  for errors.
- Fixed: Hexen's dual attack weapons must check distance to targets in 3D,
  not 2D.
- Made several DECORATE errors which do not involve parsing non-fatal.
- Added a static error counter to FScriptPosition class.
- Changed initialization of actor class type properties: fuglyname is gone as
  is the postprocessing in FinishThingdef. Instead an empty placeholder class
  is now created when a class is first referenced and this placeholder is later
  filled in. 
- Added option to replace backslash with '^' in state frame definitions because
  the backslash is just causing too many problems because it's also an escape
  character.

December 28, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's new DMFlags submission.

December 27, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The correct player class was not remembered when the menu had both
  a player class selection menu and an episode menu.
- Fixed: AddToConsole could write outside its working buffer.
- Fixed: 0 was no longer recognized as placeholder for 'no state' in A_Chase.
- Fixed: When picking up weapons the code did not check if it should switch away
  from weak weapons.

December 20, 2008
- OggMod improperly decodes the right channel of stereo samples when sending
  them to OggEnc, so I have no choice but to convert them to mono by chopping
  off the right channel and only using the left channel information.

December 19, 2008
- Fixed: OggMod passes the raw sample data to OggEnc for stereo samples, so
  the resultant Vorbis stream is not actually stereo but mono with the right
  channel after the left. The two need to be interleaved just like
  uncompressed samples are.
- Removed the pattern length limit in the XM reader.

December 18, 2008
- Decal changes as per Xaser's suggestions: Smaller decal for PhoenixFX2,
  CrossbowFX2 and MaceFX4 were missing decals, and HornRodFX2 gets a whole
  new decal.
- Fixed: bfgscrc2.png had some holes in the middle that did not look so good.
  (From previously being handled through WinTex, maybe?)

December 17, 2008
- Fixed: Thing_ProjectileIntercept broke slightly when converted to the new
  vector math routines (almost two years ago!) because the original code
  multiplied down columns of the rotation matrix, but the new code multiplies
  across rows of the matrix instead. This is remedied by flipping the matrix
  across the x=y axis by reversing the sign of the sine value passed to the
  matrix constructor.

December 15, 2008
- Fixed: Autoloading a game (e.g. respawning after dying in single player)
  during demo playback prematurely ended demo control of the player.
- Fixed: Loading a multiplayer save with only one player crashed.
- Changed the co-op intermission screen to draw the stats with the small font.
- Added Karate Chris's patch to optionally specify an angle offset for
  summoning.
- Added Karate Chris's fix for Serpent Staff vampirism on teammates.
- Locks and teleporters now take precedence over one-sidedness for automap
  coloring.
- Increased maximum number of per-pattern rows for the XM loader from
  256 to 1024 to deal with a module that otherwise would not load.
- Removed the artificial restriction on not supporting Vorbis-compressed
  samples in XMs if they are stereo, since it turns out that OggMod does
  support them.

December 12, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a SECF_NORESPAWN flag for sectors that prevents players from being respawned
  in such a sector. As a workaround for current map formats a new actor
  (DoomEdNum 9041) was added that can set the extended sector flags without the
  use of ACS and sector tags. The new flag can also be set with Sector_ChangeFlags.
- Fixed: Players ignored MF2_TELESTOMP and always telefragged what was in the way.
- Fixed: Actors with MF5_NOINTERACTION were not affected by the time freezer.

December 7, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a strbin1 function that does the same as strbin but creates a copy 
  instead of overwriting the original string. ACS performing this operation
  in place caused crashes with RTC-3057.
- fixed: FScriptPosition::Message did not print the message if it was not 
  a fatal error.
- Fixed: The save percentage for Doom's green armor was slightly too low
  which caused roundoff errors that made it less than 1/3 effective.
- Added support for "RRGGBB" strings to V_GetColor.
- Fixed: Desaturation maps for the TEXTURES lump were calculated incorrectly.
- Changed GetSpriteIndex to cache the last used sprite name so that the code
  using this function doesn't have to do it itself.
- Moved some more code for the state parser into p_states.cpp.
- Fixed: TDeletingArray should not try to delete NULL pointers.

December 6, 2008
- Added binary (b) and hexadecimal (x) cast types for ACS's various print
  statements.
- Added ClassifyActor(tid) ACS builtin function. This takes a TID and returns
  a set of bits describing the actor. If TID is 0, it returns information
  about the activator. If there is more than one actor with the given TID,
  only the first one is considered. Currently defined bits are:
    ACTOR_NONE         No actors with this TID exist (only when TID is not 0).
    ACTOR_WORLD        Activator is the world (only when TID is 0).
    ACTOR_PLAYER       Actor is a player (includes bots and voodoo dolls).
    ACTOR_BOT          Actor is a bot.
    ACTOR_VOODOODOLL   Actor is a voodoo doll.
    ACTOR_MONSTER      Actor is a monster.
    ACTOR_ALIVE        Actor is alive (players/monsters only).
    ACTOR_DEAD         Actor is dead (players/monsters only).
    ACTOR_MISSILE      Actor is a missile.
    ACTOR_GENERIC      Actor exists, but no further information is available.
- Moved ExpandEnvVars() from d_main.cpp to cmdlib.cpp.
- AutoExec paths now support the same variable expansion as the search paths.
  Additionally, on Windows, the default autoexec path is now relative to
  $PROGDIR, rather than using a fixed path to the executable's current
  directory.
- All usable Autoload and AutoExec sections are now created at the top of
  the config file along with some brief explanatory notes so they are
  readily visible to anyone who wants to edit them.

December 6, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: G_DoPlayDemo did not free the demobuffer or the CVAR backups when it
  failed to start the demo.

December 2, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a MF5_BRIGHT flag to always render an actor fullbright.
- Fixed: Calling Door_Animated with a non-zero tag created a new thinker
  for each two-sided line of the sector.

December 1, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's submission for making 'spray' a cheat.
- Added CO2's default parameter additions for several Doom code pointers
  submission.
- Added CO2's A_RemoveMaster/A_RemoveChildren submission.
- Added Blzut3's SBARINFO replacement for the Doom statusbar.
- Fixed: SBarInfo still displayed the wrong bar for height 0
- Added A_KillSiblings and A_DamageSiblings code pointers.
- added MaxAbsorb and MaxFullAbsorb properties for Armor.

December 1, 2008
- Restored the multiplayer scoreboard's former centering so that it doesn't
  look awful on widescreen intermissions. Also changed the column widths to
  be font-dependant rather than fixed proportions of the screen width.
- Fixed horizontal positioning of 'finished' on the Raven games when scaled.

November 30, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: 'finished' wasn't drawn on the intermission because the space 
  check compared scaled with unscaled coordinates.
- Changed: Textures without a name no longer get added to the texture manager's 
  hash chains.
- Fixed: specifying texture patches or font characters by full lump name instead
  of texture name didn't work. To do this properly the texture manager needs
  an option to look for a texture by lump number so that such textures can
  be maintained without interfering with regular operation.
- added 'skystretch' and 'autosequences' keywords for MAPINFO so that the effects
  of 'noautosequences' and 'forcenoskystretch' can be cancelled.
- Added a 'gamedefaults' section to MAPINFO after discovering that 'defaultmap'
  gets reset for each MAPINFO. A global section is needed to define a game's
  default setting in zdoom.pk3. The gamedefaults should normally not be changed 
  by PWADs but it can be done if some mod intends to change gameplay settings 
  but wants to allow custom add-ons on its own.

November 29, 2008
- Fixed alignment of "finished" line in WI_drawLF() when the level name is a
  graphic and scaled.
- It is now possible to replace the game's SmallFont with a single lump font
  called SMALLFNT.
- Reduced the width of the second column in wi_percents false mode from 3 to
  2 characters.
- Added a WISLASH graphic for Doom's intermission screen when wi_percents is
  false.

November 29, 2008 (sbarinfo update)
- Added: inventorybarnotvisible to check to see if the inventory bar is up.
- Added the following flags to drawselectedinventory center, centerbottom, and
  drawshadow.
- Fixed: The translucent flag for drawinventorybar should only have affected
  the artibox image.

November 27, 2008
- Removed S_MarkSoundChannels(), as it caused all non-actor sounds to
  have their origins zeroed during collections.
- WI_drawLF() now draws the level name at the top of the screen, always.
- Fixed: disabling lowerHealthCap didn't affect interpolateHealth.
- The co-op summary screen now has a totals row at the bottom (if it fits).
- Changed WI_drawPercent() when wi_percents is false so that the total
  display is optional, and it formats it like Heretic's intermission, with
  a slash and a fixed-width right column.

November 21, 2008
- Font is no longer a property of the screen object. Pass the font to
  DrawText and DrawChar directly instead.
- Doom's intermission characters are now collected together as a font
  so they can be colorized.

November 18, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: compatf_limitpain must check for 21 Lost Souls, not 20.

November 15, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved common code of Raven's fast projectiles into a base class
  called FastProjectile. This base class doesn't have any effects attached
  so that it can be used for user defined fast projectiles.

November 14, 2008
- Removed GC barriers from the sound channels. If we must, we can always
  do it the old way and scan every channel to see if it matches an actor/
  entchannel pair.
- Fixed: S_RelinkSounds() did not move the SoundChans bitfield to the new
  actor.
- Fixed: Stolen channels could be kept around by the high-level channels
  indefinitely.
- Fixed: AMageStaffFX2::IsOkayToAttack() / A_MStaffAttack aimed at friendlies.
- Added kill count awareness to A_ChangeFlag.
- P_NightmareRespawn() now clears the MTF_AMBUSH flag, so respawned monsters
  aren't dormant (since there would be no way to activate them, and they
  were certainly not dormant when they died).

November 8, 2008
- Made sdl/i_system.cpp:I_GetTimePolled() functionally equivalent to the
  Win32 version.
- Updated fmod_wrap.h and fmodsound.cpp for FMOD 4.20.
- GCC warning removal.

November 2, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The TEXTURES parser didn't report an error for invalid keywords.
- Fixed: The DECORATE expression evaluator was too strict with missing jump labels.
  For compatibility it only may print a warning, not an error.

October 29, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: FxClassTypeCast::Resolve didn't work for NULL classes because a variable
  was not initialized.

October 28, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The railgun attack functions still read their puff parameters as names
  even though they are now passed as class pointers.
- Fixed: The state parser counted one parameter too many for a varargs function.
- Fixed: FStateExpressions could copy unresolved default parameter expressions.
  When these were resolved and changed later all copied pointers pointed to
  invalid data.

October 26, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added read and write barriers to the actor pointer in the sound channel
  structure.
- Fixed: Items which should stay but had an IF_ALWAYSPICKUP flag were removed.
- Fixed: The pickup flash must only play when an item is picked up so the 
  correct place to spawn it is in AInventory::Touch, not in AInventory::GoAway.
- Fixed: A_Jump didn't properly determine a state's owner anymore when called
  from weapons.

October 25, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added NULL checks to all places where class names are passed as DECORATE
  parameters.
- All DECORATE parameters are passed as expressions now. This change allows
  for compile time checks of all class names being used in DECORATE so many
  incorrect definitions may output warnings now.

October 23, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: S_StopChannel now resets the actor's sound flags. The previous bug
  made me think that delaying this until FMod calls the end of sound callback 
  may simply be too late.
- Fixed: The high level sound code must not rely on FMod immediately returning 
  the sound channel data when a sound is being stopped. This caused
  an endless loop when changing levels with Strife's Flamethrower active.

October 22, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed DECORATE sound and color parameters to use expressions.

October 21, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a proper function parser to the expression evaluator and converted
  sin/cos and action specials to use it. The old evaluator is gone now.
- fixed some GCC problems with autosegs.

October 20, 2008
- Game time is now frozen during screen wipes. This obsoletes the DEM_WIPEON
  and DEM_WIPEOFF commands. Fixes multimap demos desyncing when played back
  or recorded with wipes enabled, and prevents multiplayer games from
  starting until all players' wipes have finished.

October 19, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added native variables to expression evaluator and replaced the previous
  handling of actor variables in expressions with it.
- Added support for floating point constants to DECORATE expression evaluator.

October 18, 2008
- Rewrote the SeePastShootableLines check in P_SightCheckLine() to be
  more readable.
- Commented out the MugShot state nulling in DSBarInfo::AttachToPlayer() so
  that fiddling with player options does not reset the mug shot.
- Fixed: SetMugShotState ACS command did not pop the stack.

October 18, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a global symbol table and changed DECORATE parser to put its global 
  symbols there instead of into AActor.
- Changed the expression evaluator's floating point precision to double.
- Started rewriting the DECORATE expression evaluator to allow more flexibility.
  All the operators use the new functionality but functions, variables and
  constants are yet to be redone.
  While doing this rewrite I noticed that random2 was always evaluated as const.
  This got fixed automatically.

October 13, 2008
- This may or may not be a problem, but GCC warned that FStateDefinitions::
  AddStateDefines() does not initialize def.FStateDefine::DefineFlags, so
  I fixed that.
- Fixed: The three-argument version of AActor::FindState() initialized a
  two-entry array for passing to the main FindState() routine, but did
  not actually pass it, passing the original primary label instead.
- Fixed: SDL builds did not shutdown the sound system at exit.
- Fixed: ThingCountSector and ThingCountNameSector did not remove enough
  entries from the stack, and did not put the result in the right slot.
- Fixed: Teleport lines were prioritized over secret lines when deciding what
  color to draw them on the automap.
- Fixed: Death-reverting morphs did not remove the morph item from the
  player's inventory when death caused the morph to revert.
- Updated fmod_wrap.h for FMOD Ex 4.18.

October 10, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The TEXTURES parser could copy beyond the end of a string when parsing
  a 'define' definition.

October 7, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Cheats in demos must not access the weapon slots.
- Fixed: S_ChannelEnded didn't check for a NULL SfxInfo.
- Fixed: R_InitTables did a typecast to angle_t instead of fixed_t.

October 6, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PowerProtection and PowerDamage applied their defaults incorrectly.
- Fixed: The damage type property didn't properly read its factor.

October 5, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Finally has the right idea how to restore Doom's original clipping of projectiles
  against decorations without breaking anything newer:
  Added a new 'projectilepassheight' property that defines an alternative height
  that is only used when checking a projectile's movement against this actor.
  If the value is positive it is used regardless of other settings, if it is
  negative, its absolute will be used if a new compatibility option is enabled
  and if it is 0 the normal height will be used.
- Fixed: Powerup.Color's handler contained an unnecessary 'else' which resulted
  in opaque powerup blends.

October 4, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Resurrecting a player didn't unset the RF_INVISIBLE flag which is
  set when the player is crushed to gibs under a door.

September 28, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Dropitem gave incorrect amounts to the item if a probability was set.

September 27, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: weapon.ammogive2 always gave 2 amounts of ammo.
- Fixed: The translation string parser printed a broken error message.

September 24, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: player.colorrange didn't read the parameters correctly.
- Reverted an 'optimization' in d_dehacked.cpp that didn't work.

September 23, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Old style decorations forgot all inherited states when installing 
  their labels.
  
September 22, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Used the one unused byte in the state structure as a flag to tell what type
  the NextState parameter is. The code did some rather unsafe checks with it
  to determine its type.
- moved all state related code into a new file: p_states.cpp.
- merged all FindState functions. All the different variations are now inlined
  and call the same function to do the real work.

September 21, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- did some code cleanup and reorganization in thingdef.cpp.
- Replaced the translation parser for TEXTURES with FRemapTable::AddToTranslation.
- To get the game name the screenshot code might as well use the globally
  available GameNames array instead of creating its own list.
- Moved backpack names for cheat into gameinfo.
- Fixed: SNDINFO must be loaded before the textures. However, this required
  some changes to the MAPINFO parser which tried to access the texture manager
  to check if the level name patches exist. That check had to be moved to
  where the intermission screen is set up.
- Fixed: 'bloodcolor' ignored the first parameter value when given a list
  of integers.
  Please note that this creates an incompatibility between old and new 
  versions so if you want to create something that works with both 2.2.0
  and current versions better use the string format version for the color
  parameter!
- Rewrote the DECORATE property parser so that the parser is completely
  separated from the property handlers. This should allow reuse of all 
  the handler code for a new format if Doomscript requires one.
- Fixed: PClass::InitializeActorInfo copied too many bytes if a subclass's
  defaults were larger than the parent's.
- Moved A_ChangeFlag to thingdef_codeptr.cpp.
- Moved translation related code from thingdef_properties.cpp to r_translate.cpp
  and rewrote the translation parser to use FScanner instead of strtol.
- replaced DECORATE's 'alpha default' by 'defaultalpha' for consistency.
  Since this was never used outside zdoom.pk3 it's not critical.
- Removed support for game specific pickup messages because the only thing
  this was ever used for - Raven's invulnerability item - has already been
  split up into a Heretic and Hexen version.

September 20, 2008
- Fixed: The Timidity config parser always tried to process the note number,
  even if it wasn't specified.

September 19, 2008
- Fixed: When UpdateJoystickMenu() modifies the menu items for different
  controllers, the joystick axis selectors need to NULL the d.graycheck
  field, since this is shared by the axis sensitivity sliders' step values.

September 19, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The crosshair must be initialized after the texture manager because
  on the fly texture creation for graphics patches is no longer supported.
- Fixed a few Linux compile errors.

September 16, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: Replaced weapons should not be given by generic cheats, only
  when explicitly giving them.
- Changed 'give weapon' cheat so that in single player it only gives weapons
  belonging to the current game or are placed in a weapon slot to avoid
  giving the Chex Quest weapons in Doom and vice versa.
- Fixed: The texture manager must be the first thing to be initialized
  because MAPINFO and DECORATE both can reference textures and letting them
  create their own textures is not safe.

September 15, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Separated low level sound code from all high level dependencies.
- Separated low level sound channel class from high level class which now
  is just a subclass of the low level class.
- Moved some more high level sound logic out of FMODSoundRenderer:
  The rolloff and channel ended callbacks now call functions in s_sound.cpp
  instead of working on the data itself and GSnd->StopSound has been replaced
  with S_StopChannel.
- Changed compilation for g_doom, g_heretic, g_hexen and g_strife folders so 
  that all files are included by a central one instead of compiling each one 
  separately. This speeds up the compilation process by 25% when doing a 
  complete rebuild in Visual C.

September 14, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Cleaned up some include dependencies.
- fixed: For Chex Quest some CVars were initialized to Heretic's default.
- fixed pickup message for LargeZorchPack.

September 13, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved IF_ALWAYSPICKUP and GiveQuest into CallTryPickup so that they are
  automatically used by all inventory classes.
- The previous change made it necessary to replace all TryPickup calls with
  another function that just calls TryPickup.
- Fixed: AInventory::TryPickup can change the toucher so this must be reported
  to subclasses calling the super function. Changed TryPickup to pass the
  toucher pointer by reference.
- Prefixed all names of CQ decorations with Chex after seeing some conflicts
  with PWADs.
- Removed Chex Quest actors that were just unaltered duplicates of Doom's.
- Added detection for Chex Quest 3 IWAD.
- Cleaned up M_QuitGame because the code was almost incomprehensible and I
  wanted to add CQ3's new quit messages.
- Added Chex Quest obituaries and a few other messages from CQ3.
- Fixed: drawbar improperly clipped images when not in the top left quadrant.
- Fixed: Crouching no longer worked due to a bug introduced by the
  player input code.

September 12, 2008
- Added GetPlayerInput() for examining a player's inputs from ACS. Most
  buttons are now passed across the network, and there are four new user
  buttons specifically for use with this command. Also defined +zoom
  and +reload for future implementation.

September 11, 2008
- Fixed: Hexen's fourth weapon pieces did not play the correct pickup sound,
  and when they were fully assembled, they did not play the sound across the
  entire level.
- Antialiasing of lines is now controlled solely by the vid_hwaalines cvar,
  ignoring what the driver reports, since ATI is apparently just as bad as
  NVidia.

September 9, 2008
- Added a check for D3DLINECAPS_ANTIALIAS, but this is complicated by the
  fact that NVidia's don't report it, even though they support it. If there
  are any cards that no longer have antialised lines on the automap, please
  let me know.
- Added vid_hwaalines cvar to force antialiased lines off for the
  Direct3D renderer, in case it doesn't really support them.

September 9, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The new rolloff values being stored in FSoundChan need to be serialized
  for savegames.
- Since loading of the sound lump is now done in S_LoadSound I added an IsNull
  method to the SoundRenderer class so that this function doesn't need to 
  load the sound for the NullSoundRenderer.
- Took some more non-FMOD related code out of fmodsound.cpp, including the
  code that checks for raw and Doom sounds. This means that sfxinfo_t is no
  longer needed in the SoundRenderer class so I took out all references to it.
- Fixed: FMODSoundRenderer::StartSound3D must set the static variable pointing
  to the rolloff information back to NULL when starting the sound fails.
- Fixed: Rolloff information was taken from the sfxinfo that contained the
  actual sound data, not the one that was used for starting the sound.

September 7, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Chex Quest's Super Bootspork was missing the pickup message.
- Added missing Strife automap colors for items and non-monsters.
- Fixed: GetMSLength didn't resolve random and player sounds.
- Moved sound aliasing code out of fmodsound.cpp into S_LoadSound.

September 6, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The tagged version of TranslucentLine took the information for additive
  translucency from the tagged linedef, not the control linedef.
- Added check for additive translucency to TRANMAP checking.
- Changed listener structure to directly contain the sound environment instead
  of getting it from the zone in the low level code.
- Changed sound interface so that all references to game data like actors
  and sectors are done in s_sound.cpp and not in fmodsound.cpp. Also removed
  several 'sector' parameters because they were never used inside the sound code.

September 5, 2008
- Added the "extended" keyword for episode definitions to define episodes
  that are only available in the extended version of Heretic.
- Added hexendemo.wad and hexdemo.wad as aliases for the demo Hexen IWAD.
- Added IWAD checks for freedoom1.wad and freedm.wad.
- The garbage collector now has an opportunity to step each time individual
  thinkers tick, not just once every game tick. This more closely follows
  the original Lua behavior. This change was made because, in cases of
  extremely large and frequent memory allocations, the collector may not run
  fast enough if it only has a chance to execute once per tick.

September 4, 2008
- Fixed: The "same level" dmflag did not work.
- Changed the nextlevel global var to an FString.
- Implemented some more controllers for the OPL player:
  * RPN select (controllers 100 and 101)
  *  RPN 0 (pitch bend sensitivity)
  * NPRN select (controllers 98 and 99)
  * Data entry (controllers 6 and 38)
  * All notes off (controller 123)
  * All sounds off (controller 120)
  * Reset controllers (controller 121)
- Added pixel doubling and quadrupling for fullscreen DirectDraw modes.
  The command line options -2 and -4 can be used to force them.

September 4, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Red blood particles used too dark colors.
- Fixed: The smoothlighting code in side_t::GetLightLevel relied on 
  the global 'linedef' variable for automatic fake contrast although
  this issue had already been fixed for the original code here.
- Replaced static string buffers with FString in FONTDEFS parser.

September 1, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added an 'allcheats' CVAR. This will enable all cheats from all
  supported games in any game being played.
- Changed Chex Quest DoomEdNum initilization so that all empty slots 
  are filled with Doom actors if they exist.
- Added missing spawn filters to Chex Quest items.
- Gave the PlayerPawn base class a default damage fade color instead of
  hacking it into the actor when actually used.
- Fixed: The DamageFade color was not saved in savegames.

August 30, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Blzut3's patch for a real Chex Quest game mode.

August 29, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: SKIP_SUPER doesn't work for inventory items so it must be
  disabled for them
- Fixed: Chex Quest doesn't have a HELP2 screen so it must not be used
  in the gameinfo.
- Fixed: Default blood color is no longer red so P_DrawSplash2 must
  get it from the gameinfo instead.
- Added new French language texts by DoomKn1ght_.
  
August 26, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Blood default color is set in the gameinfo now so that Chex Quest
  can default to green instead of red.
- Fixed: The version of CheckNumForFullName that checks for a specific
  WAD did not work.
- Moved MAPINFO names into gameinfo structure.
- Added Chex Quest support. Credits go to fraggle for creating a 
  Dehacked patch that does most of the work. The rest includes a new
  MAPINFO and removal of the drop items from the monsters being used.

August 23, 2008
- Added Win64 support to the crash report generator. (Pity that Win32
  cannot be as informative.)

August 22, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added and fixed Boss death submission for random spawner.
- Added functions to FActorInfo that can set the damage factors and
  pain chances to reduce the chance of new errors when working with
  these features.
- Fixed: The handling of the deprecated FIRERESIST flag didn't work.
  There were 3 problems:
  * Actor defaults have no class information so HandleDeprecatedFlags
    needs to be passed a pointer to the ActorInfo.
  * The DamageFactors list is only created when needed so the code needs to
    check if it already exists.
  * damage factors are stored as fixed_t but this set a float.

August 22, 2008
- Fixed: Timidity::Renderer::reset_voices() must completely zero the
  voices. Because this wasn't done, note_on() could try to access
  the sample for a voice that had never been played yet and access
  random memory. There may be other places where it's a problem, but
  this is where I noticed it, by chance.

August 21, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a traditional Strife color set for the automap.

August 21, 2008  (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The conversion of the strings in wbstartstruct_t to FStrings
  caused crashes when reloading the hub data.
- Replaced WALLF_AUTOCONTRAST with WALLF_NOFAKECONTRAST so that the 
  default setting for the flags is 0.
- Added: doom2day's smoothlighting
- Added: dontincrement argument to A_CheckForReload.
- Fixed: The UDMF parser wrote class filter bits into SkillFilter.
- Fixed: (SBARINFO patch) DrawInventoryBar has a missing argument in 
  one of its drawgraphic calls.

August 20, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Gez's patch for Heretic's GIMME cheat.
- Externalized some cheat strings.

August 19, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Gez's patch for removing MF4_FIRERESIST.

August 18, 2008 (SBARINFO patch)
- Fixed: DrawBar would not show.
- Fixed: IsSelected took string constants instead of identifiers.

August 16, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Put more floor/ceiling properties in sector_t into a substructure and
  added wrapper functions.
- Fixed: A_Explode wants the distance parameter as an int, not a fixed_t.
- some minor DECORATE fixes.

August 14, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The count parameter of A_Jump is a constant, not an expression.
- Fixed: A_Jump used a wrong index into the jump address table.
- Fixed: The recent changes in the DECORATE parser require the special parameter
  to A_CallSpecial to be an expression, not a constant.
- Removed game filters from old style decorations. No WAD in existence ever 
  used them and removing them allows to make the parser more robust.
- Added a few more macros so that the action function code doesn't have
  to reference its arguments directly, except 'self'. This may be helpful if it 
  becomes necessary to restructure this code once DoomScript becomes real.
- Removed the last remaining global variable related to action functions:
  pStateCall. Everything is passed properly as function arguments now.
- fixed: PlayerChunk was missing the NOSKIN flag.

August 13, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Macro-fied access to action function parameters.
- Deactivated debug output code in d_Dehacked.cpp.
- fixed: A_FreezeDeathChunks crashed when a player's head got spawned.
- fixed: A_CallSpecial must be declared in DECORATE so that a symbol table
  entry can be generated for it.
- fixed: Dehacked replaced pickups multiple times for changing its states.
- fixed: Dehacked must copy AInventory's state to any item it hacks to be a 
  pickup.
- fixed a few more DECORATE bugs.

August 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The chat sound for Strife was misnamed in the gameinfo structure.
- fixed a few DECORATE bugs.
- Changed the action function declaration parser so that optional parameters
  can be given a default value. The 'optional' keyword is no longer needed
  and was removed, as well as 'evalnot'.
- Restructured the action function interface to remove the dependence on
  the global CallingState variable.
- Changed handling of AUTOPAGE texture so that it is properly inserted into
  the texture manager even if it is from Raven's IWADs.
- Removed code related to internal ActorInfo definitions from dobjtype.cpp.
- removed unneeded file dehackedactions.h

August 11, 2008
- Ported asm_x86_64/tmap3.nas to AT&T syntax so it can be compiled with gas.
  After finding out that gas does have directives to describe the .eh_frame
  metadata, I figured that would be significantly easier and quicker than
  trying to locate all the scattered docs needed to construct it by hand.
  Unfortunately, this now means I have to maintain two versions of exactly
  the same code. :(

August 11, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed 'eval' modifier from DECORATE. All int, float and bool parameters are
  'eval' now by default.
- Did a thorough check of all DECORATE conversions and fixed the errors I found.

August 10, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Macro-fied all access to action functions.
- Changed action function definition so that they have to be defined with a
  DEFINE_ACTION_FUNCTION macro. This should make it easier to improve the
  whole system.
- Removed DECORATE's ParseClass because it was only used to add data to fully
  internal actor classes which no longer exist.
- Changed the state structure so that the Tics value doesn't need to be hacked
  into misc1 with SF_BIGTIC anymore. 
- Changed sprite processing so that sprite names are converted to indices 
  during parsing so that an additional postprocessing step is no longer needed.
- Fixed: Sprite names in DECORATE were case sensitive.
- Exported AActor's defaults to DECORATE and removed all code for the 
  internal property parser which is no longer needed.
- Converted the Heresiarch to DECORATE.
- Added an Active and Inactive state for monsters.
- Made the speed a parameter to A_RaiseMobj and A_SinkMobj and deleted
  GetRaiseSpeed and GetSinkSpeed.
- Added some remaining DECORATE conversions for Hexen by Karate Chris.

August 10, 2008
- Changed Windows to use the performance counter instead of rdtsc.
- Changed Linux to use clock_gettime for profiling instead of rdtsc. This
  avoids potential erroneous results on multicore and variable speed
  processors.

August 9, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the last of Hexen's inventory items to DECORATE so that I could
  export AInventory.
- Removed AT_GAME_SET because it's no longer used anywhere.
- Converted the last remaining global classes to DECORATE.
- Fixed: Inventory.PickupFlash requires an class name as parameter not an
  integer. Some Hexen definitions got it wrong.
- Converted Hexen's Pig to DECORATE.
- Replaced the ActorInfo definitions of all internal inventory classes with 
  DECORATE definitions.
- Added option to specify a powerup's duration in second by using a negative
  number.

August 8, 2008
- Added Gez's Freedoom detection patch.
- SBARINFO update:
  * Added: The ability to have drawkeybar auto detect spacing.
  * Added: Offset parameter to drawkeybar to allow two key bars with
    different keys.
  * Added: Multi-row/column keybar parameters.  Spacing can also be auto.
    These  defualt to left to right/top to bottom but can be switched.
  * Added: Drawshadow flag to drawnumber.  This will draw a solid color and
    translucent number under the normal number.
  * Added: hexenarmor to drawimage.  This takes a parameter for a hexen
    armor type and will fade the image like the hexen status bar.
  * Added: centerbottom offset to draw(switchable)image.
  * Added: translucent flag to drawinventorybar.
  * Fixed: Accidentally removed flag from DrawTexture that allowed negative
    coordinates to work with fullscreenoffsets.  Hopefully this is the last
    major bug in the fullscreenoffsets system.
- Ported vlinetallasm4 to AMD64 assembly. Even with the increased number of
  registers AMD64 provides, this routine still needs to be written as self-
  modifying code for maximum performance. The additional registers do allow
  for further optimization over the x86 version by allowing all four pixels
  to be in flight at the same time. The end result is that AMD64 ASM is about
  2.18 times faster than AMD64 C and about 1.06 times faster than x86 ASM.
  (For further comparison, AMD64 C and x86 C are practically the same for
  this function.) Should I port any more assembly to AMD64, mvlineasm4 is the
  most likely candidate, but it's not used enough at this point to bother.
  Also, this may or may not work with Linux at the moment, since it doesn't
  have the eh_handler metadata. Win64 is easier, since I just need to
  structure the function prologue and epilogue properly and use some
  assembler directives/macros to automatically generate the metadata. And
  that brings up another point: You need YASM to assemble the AMD64 code,
  because NASM doesn't support the Win64 metadata directives.

August 8, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Replaced the ActorInfo definitions of several internal classes with DECORATE definitions
- Converted teleport fog and destinations to DECORATE.
- AActor::PreExplode is gone now that the last item that was using it has been converted.
- Converted the Sigil and the remaining things in a_strifeitems.cpp to DECORATE.
- Exported Point pushers, CustomSprite and AmbientSound to DECORATE.
- Changed increased lightning damage for Centaurs into a damage factor.
- Changed PoisonCloud and Lightning special treatment in P_DamageMobj to use damage
  types instead to keep dependencies on specific actor types out of the main engine code.
- Added Korax DECORATE conversion by Gez and a few others by Karate Chris.
- Removed FourthWeaponClass and based Hexen's fourth weapons on the generic weapon
  pieces.
- Added DECORATE conversions for Hexen's Fighter weapons by Karate Chris.
- Added aWeaponGiver class to generalize the standing AssaultGun.
- converted a_Strifeweapons.cpp to DECORATE, except for the Sigil.

August 7, 2008
- Added an SSE version of DoBlending. This is strictly C intrinsics.
  VC++ still throws around unneccessary register moves. GCC seems to be
  pretty close to optimal, requiring only about 2 cycles/color. They're
  both faster than my hand-written MMX routine, so I don't need to feel
  bad about not hand-optimizing this for x64 builds.
- Removed an extra instruction from DoBlending_MMX, transposed two
  instructions, and unrolled it once, shaving off about 80 cycles from the
  time required to blend 256 palette entries. Why? Because I tried writing
  a C version of the routine using compiler intrinsics and was appalled by
  all the extra movq's VC++ added to the code. GCC was better, but still
  generated extra instructions. I only wanted a C version because I can't
  use inline assembly with VC++'s x64 compiler, and x64 assembly is a bit
  of a pain. (It's a pain because Linux and Windows have different calling
  conventions, and you need to maintain extra metadata for functions.) So,
  the assembly version stays and the C version stays out.

August 7, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the rest of a_strifestuff.cpp to DECORATE.
- Fixed: AStalker::CheckMeleeRange did not perform all checks of AActor::CheckMeleeRange.
  I replaced this virtual override with a new flag MF5_NOVERTICALMELEERANGE so that
  this feature can also be used by other actors.
- Converted Strife's Stalker to DECORATE.
- Converted ArtiTeleport to DECORATE.
- Removed the NoBlockingSet method from AActor because everything using it has been
  converted to DECORATE using DropItem instead.
- Changed: Macil doesn't need the StrifeHumanoid's special death states so he might
  as well inherit directly from AActor.
- Converted Strife's Coin, Oracle, Macil and StrifeHumanoid to DECORATE. Also moved
  the burning hand states to StrifePlayer where they really belong.
- Added Gez's dropammofactor submission with some necessary changes. Also merged
  redundant ammo multiplication code from P_DropItem and ADehackedPickup::TryPickup.
- Restricted native action function definitions to zdoom.pk3.
- Fixed. The Firedemon was missing a game filter.

August 7, 2008 (SBARINfO update)
- Added: disablegrin, disableouch, disablepain, and disablerampage flags to
  drawmugshot.
- Fixed: LowerHealthCap did not work properly.
- Fixed: Various bugs I noticed in the fullscreenoffsets code.

August 6, 2008
- Removed all the pixel doubling r_detail modes, since the one platform they
  were intended to assist (486) actually sees very little benefit from them.
- Rewrote CheckMMX in C and renamed it to CheckCPU.
- Fixed: CPUID function 0x80000005 is specified to return detailed L1 cache
  only for AMD processors, so we must not use it on other architectures, or
  we end up overwriting the L1 cache line size with 0 or some other number
  we don't actually understand.
- The x87 precision control is now explicitly set for double precision, since
  GCC defaults to extended precision instead, unlike Visual C++.

August 6, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted Strife's Programmer, Loremaster and Thingstoblowup to DECORATE.
- Fixed: Attacking a merchant in Strife didn't alert the enemies.
- Removed AT_GAME_SET(PowerInvulnerable) due to the problems it caused. The two
  occurences in the code that depended on it were changed accordingly.
  Invulnerability colormaps are now being set by the items exclusively.
- Changed many checks for the friendly Minotaur to a new flag MF5_SUMMONEDMONSTER
  so that it can hopefully be generalized to be usable elsewhere later.
- Added Gez's submission for converting the Minotaur to DECORATE.
- Fixed a few minor DECORATE bugs.
- Changed coordinate storage for EntityBoss so that it works properly even
  when the pod is not used to spawn it.
- Converted Strife's Spectres and Entity to DECORATE.

August 6, 2008 (SBARINfO update)
- Added: fullscreenoffsets flag for status bars.  This changes the coordinate
  system to be relative to the top left corner of the screen.  This is useful
  for full screen status bars.
- Changed: drawinventorybar will use the width of artibox or invcurs (strife)
  to determine the spacing.  Let me know if this breaks any released mods.
- Fixed: If a status bar height of 0 was specified in SBarInfo the wrong bar
  would be shown.
- Fixed: If a static inventory bar was used the user still had to press invuse
  in order to get rid of the "overlay".
- Fixed: forcescaled would not work if the height of the bar was 0.
- Added: keyslot to drawswitchableimage.
- Fixed: The transition effects for the log and keys popups were switched.

August 5, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted Strife's Crusader, Inquisitor and spectral missiles to
  DECORATE.
- Converted Strife's Acolytes, Rebels, Sentinel, Reaver and Templar to
  DECORATE.
- Added DECORATE conversions for Hexen's Cleric weapons by Karate Chris.
- Added a check to Zipdir that excludes files with a .orig extension. These
  can be left behind by patch.exe and create problems.
- fixed: Unmorphing from chicken caused a crash when reading non-existent
  meta-data strings.
- Converted the ScriptedMarines to DECORATE.
- Fixed: DLightTransfer and DWallLightTransfer were declared as actors.

August 3, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the PhoenixRod and associated classes to DECORATE to make
  the Heretic conversion complete.
- Converted the Minotaur's projectiles to DECORATE so that I can get
  rid of the AT_SPEED_SET code.
- Converted Heretic's Blaster and SkullRod to DECORATE.
- Converted the mace and all related actors to DECORATE and generalized
  the spawn function that only spawns one mace per level.
- Moved Mace respawning code into AInventory so that it works properly
  for replacement actors.
- Added more DECORATE conversions by Karate Chris.
- Cleaned up the new bridge code and exported all related actors to
  DECORATE so that the exported code pointers can be used.
- Separated Heretic's and Hexen's invulnerability items for stability 
  reasons.

August 2, 2008
- Fixed spurious warnings on 32-bit VC++ debug builds.
- Made the subsong (order) number a proper parameter to MusInfo::Play()
  instead of requiring a separate SetPosition() call to do it.

August 2, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Gez's submission for custom bridge things.
- Fixed: ASpecialSpot must check the array's size before dividing by it.
- Fixed: The mugshot drawe ignored the accuracy parameter.
- Fixed: The Alt HUD's weapon drawer didn't check properly for invalid icons.
- Added DECORATE conversions for Hexen's Cleric Mace, Firedemon and fog by
  Karate Chris.

July 31, 2008
- Fixed: Attempting to load 0-length sounds caused a crash.
- Removed filename-lowercasing from zipdir.
- Fixed: The ouch face fix was lost when SBARINFO mugshot became the only
  mugshot present.
- Fixed: Mace SpawnID was assigned to the MacePowered actor instead.
- Fixed: Sorcerer2FX1's SpawnID was not restricted to Heretic.

July 27, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added several type checks to the weapon slot code.

July 26, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: Players no longer respawn in instant death sectors with 
  the 'Respawn where died' flag on.

July 24, 2008
- Applied Blzut3's 5:4 SBARINFO patch. (At least I think that's what it's
  for.)
- Corrected the revision_check target so that it always checks the revision,
  not just when src/svnrevision.h is not present.
- Added Linux support for the CMakeLists. This meant downgrading them for
  CMake 2.4, since the distros don't seem to consider 2.6 stable yet.
  As a bonus, GTK+ is no longer a required dependency; now it's optional.
- Made dehsupp ignore CR characters, so it doesn't spew warnings on Linux.

July 23, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The sounds of Strife's intro need CHAN_UI.
- Changed all instances of playing the chat sounds to use CHAN_UI.

July 21, 2008
- Converted most sprintf (and all wsprintf) calls to either mysnprintf or
  FStrings, depending on the situation.
- Changed the strings in the wbstartstruct to be FStrings.
- Changed myvsnprintf() to output nothing if count is greater than INT_MAX.
  This is so that I can use a series of mysnprintf() calls and advance the
  pointer for each one. Once the pointer goes beyond the end of the buffer,
  the count will go negative, but since it's an unsigned type it will be
  seen as excessively huge instead. This should not be a problem, as there's
  no reason for ZDoom to be using text buffers larger than 2 GB anywhere.
- Ripped out the disabled bit from FGameConfigFile::MigrateOldConfig().
- Changed CalcMapName() to return an FString instead of a pointer to a static
  buffer.
- Changed startmap in d_main.cpp into an FString.
- Changed CheckWarpTransMap() to take an FString& as the first argument.
- Changed d_mapname in g_level.cpp into an FString.
- Changed DoSubstitution() in ct_chat.cpp to place the substitutions in an
  FString.
- Fixed: The MAPINFO parser wrote into the string buffer to construct a map
  name when given a Hexen map number. This was fine with the old scanner
  code, but only a happy coincidence prevents it from crashing with the new
  code.

July 21, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added MF4_BOSSDEATH to the Minotaur.
- Fixed: The boss brain looped to the wrong state.
- Converted Heretic's Staff, GoldWand, Crossbow and Gauntlets to DECORATE.
- fixed: Morphing to a class without a face definition crashed.
- Converted all of Heretic's actors except the weapons to DECORATE.
- Added the option to define the ActorInfos for native classes in DECORATE.

July 20, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: When copying visplanes the sky texture was forgotten.
- converted the boss brain to DECORATE.
- added an abstract base class for special map spots that are maintained in 
  lists and rewrote the boss brain, the mace and DSparil to use it.
- fixed: RandomSpawners didn't destroy themselves after finishing their work.
- fixed: Textures marked as complex must not redirect to the base patch.
- fixed: Alpha for composite textures was not applied.
- fixed: The CentaurMash didn't inherit from the Centaur.
- added some NULL pointer checks to the sound code.

July 19, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: When Heretic's Mace was replaced by a non-child class A_SpawnMace still 
  treated it as a mace and wrote into some undefined memory.
- Fixed: A_BishopMissileWeave didn't initialize special2 for proper movement.
- Added a speed parameter to A_SkullAttack.
- Fixed: Black as first or only blood color didn't work.
- Fixed: Sounds played in wi_stuff.cpp and f_finale.cpp need the CHAN_UI flag.
- Fixed: Spawning a player could play the *gasp sound.
- Fixed: SBARINFO's health display didn't scale to the proper maximum.

July 18, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added const char &operator[] (unsigned int index) to FString class.
- Added Skulltag's Teleport_NoStop action special.

July 17, 2008
- Added the 'B' conversion specifier to StringFormat::VWorker() for printing
  binary numbers.

July 16, 2008
- Added CMake support for building with MinGW, MSYS, and NMake. Linux support
  is probably broken until I get around to booting into Linux again. Niceties
  provided over the existing Makefiles they're replacing:
  * All command-line builds can use the same build system, rather than having
    a separate one for MinGW and another for Linux.
  * Microsoft's NMake tool is supported as a target.
  * Progress meters.
  * Parallel makes work from a fresh checkout without needing to be primed
    first with a single-threaded make.
  * Porting to other architectures should be simplified, whenever that day
    comes.

July 15, 2008
- Replaced the makewad tool with zipdir. This handles the dependency tracking
  itself instead of generating an external makefile to do it, since I couldn't
  figure out how to generate a makefile with an external tool and include it
  with a CMake-generated makefile. Where makewad used a master list of files
  to generate the package file, zipdir just zips the entire contents of one or
  more directories.

July 15, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Strife's EntityBoss didn't copy friendliness information to the
  sub-entities.

July 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Friendly spectral monsters should be able to hurt unfriendly ones
  and vice versa.
- Fixed: In deathmatch specral missiles spawned by players should hurt other
  players.
- Fixed: SpectralLightningBigBall didn't set the proper owner for the lightning
  projectiles it spawned.
- Changed the EntityBoss's attack function to call the equivalent spectre
  functions instead of duplicating their code.
- Gave many of Strife's code pointers that only had a number as name more
  meaningful names. 
- Fixed: All spectral attacks must set 'health' first before P_CheckMissileSpawn
  is called.
- Added a compatibility option to play sector sounds from the precalculated
  center because some maps apparently abuse the behavior to make the sound
  play somewhere where it can't be heard by the player to fake silent movement.
- Fixed: The S_Sound variant taking an actor must check if the actor is not
  NULL.
- Fixed: ACS's ActivatorSound must check if the activator is valid.
- Changed stats drawing so that multi-line strings can be used.

July 9, 2008
- Added the gdtoa package from netlib's fp library so that ZDoom's printf-style
  formatting can be entirely independant of the CRT.

July 5, 2008
- Added a check to G_DoSaveGame() to prevent saving when you're not actually
  in a level.
- Fixed: Serialized player data must always be loaded, even if it's simply to
  be discarded, so that anything serialized after the players will load from
  the correct position in the file when revisiting a hub map.

July 5, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: AInventory::Tick now only calls the super method if the item is not
  owned. Having owned inventory items interact with the world is not supposed
  to happen.
- Fixed: case PCD_SECTORDAMAGE in p_acs.cpp was missing a terminating 'break'.
- Fixed: When a weapon is destroyed, its sister weapon must also be destroyed.
- Added a check for PUFFGETSOWNER to A_BFGSpray.
- Moved the PUFFGETSOWNER check into P_SpawnPuff and removed the limitation
  to players only.
- Fixed: P_SpawnMapThing still checked FMapThing::flags for the class bits 
  instead of FMapThing::ClassFilter.
- Fixed: A_CustomMissile must not let P_SpawnMissile call P_CheckMissileSpawn.
  It must do this itself after setting the proper owner.
- Fixed: CCMD(give) increased the total item count.
- Fixed: A_Stop didn't set the player specific variables to 0.

July 4, 2008
- Fixed: Screenwipes now pause sounds, since there can be sounds playing
  during them.
- UI sounds are now omitted from savegames.
- Fixed: Menu sounds had been restricted to one at a time again.
- Moved the P_SerializeSounds() call to the end of G_SerializeLevel() so that
  it will occur after the players are loaded.

July 2, 2008
- Added fixes from FreeBSD for 0-length and very large string buffers
  passed to myvsnprintf.
- Rewrote myvsnprintf to use the StringFormat routines directly so that no
  additional memory needs to be allocated from the heap.

July 1, 2008
- Polyobject sounds now play from their lines, similar to the way sector
  sounds are handled.
- Why do polyobjects have a 3D start spot? Flattened it to 2D.
- Moved the sector sound origin calculation out of fmodsound.cpp and into
  s_sound.cpp so that the near sound limiting will use the correct sound
  location for deciding on neighbors.

June 30, 2008
- Removed the S_Sound() variant that allows for pointing the origin at an
  arbitrary point. It has been replaced with a variant that takes a polyobject
  as a source, since that was the only use that couldn't be rewritten with the
  other variants. This also fixes the bug that polyobject sounds were not
  successfully saved and caused a crash when reloading the game. Note that
  this is a significant change to how equality of sound sources is determined,
  so some things may not behave quite the same as before. (Which would be a
  bug, but hopefully everything still sounds the same.)
- Adjusted the noise debug table so that fractional volume levels do not
  run into the adjacent columns.
- Added a NullSoundRenderer so that most of the checks against a NULL GSnd
  can be removed.
- Fixed: Looping sounds must always successfully allocate a channel, even if
  it's only a pre-evicted channel.

June 30, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added A_ClearReFire code pointer for weapons. Preferably A_WeaponReady should
  reset this counter but that can't be done due to unwanted side effects with
  existing weapons.
- Changed the 'scale' variable in CVAR(turbo) to double because the calculations
  depended on the current floating point precision setting and only worked properly
  when set to 'precise' in VC++.

June 29, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: I_Error and I_FatalError now use ZDoom's internal string formatting
  code to process their messages. This was necessary to handle the %zu format
  option used in some memory allocation failure messages.
- Fixed: The flat texture scaling action specials were completely broken.

June 28, 2008
- The sound code now handles restarting looping sounds itself. As far as
  the rest of the game is concerned, these sounds will never stop once they
  have been started until they are explicitly stopped. If they are evicted
  from their channels, the sound code will restart them as soon as possible.
  This means that instead of this:
	if (!S_IsActorPlayingSomething(actor, CHAN_WEAPON, -1))
	{
		S_Sound(actor, CHAN_WEAPON|CHAN_LOOP, soundid, 1, ATTN_NORM);
	}
  The following is now just as effective:
	S_Sound(actor, CHAN_WEAPON|CHAN_LOOP, soundid, 1, ATTN_NORM);
  There are also a couple of other ramifications presented by this change:
    * The full state of the sound system (sans music) is now stored in save
      games. Any sounds that were playing when you saved will still be
      playing when you load. (Try saving while Korax is making a speech in
      Hexen to hear it.)
    * Using snd_reset will also preserve any playing sounds.
    * Movie playback is disabled, probably forever. I did not want to 
      update the MovieDisable/ResumeSound stuff for the new eviction
      tracking code. A properly updated movie player will use the VMR,
      which doesn't need these functions, since it would pipe the sound
      straight through the sound system like everything else, so I decided
      to dump them now, which leaves the movie player in a totally unworkable
      state.

June 28, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed some unused constant definitions from sc_man.cpp.
- Fixed: A_FireBlasterPL2 played the weapon sound with the missile as origin
  instead of the shooting player.
- Fixed: Dead players didn't get the MF_CORPSE flag set.
- Fixed: The internal definition of Floor_LowerToNearest had incorrect parameter
  settings.
- Fixed: Heretic's ActivatedTimeBomb had the same spawn ID as the inventory item.
- fixed: Heretic's mace did not have its spawn ID set.

June 26, 2008
- Changed S_Sound() to take the same floating point attenuation that the
  internal S_StartSound() uses. Now ambient sounds can use the public
  S_Sound() interface.
- Fixed: S_RelinkSound() compared the points of the channels against the
  from actor's point, rather than checking the channels' mover.
- Changed Strife's animated doors so that their sounds originate from the
  interior of the sector making them and not from the entire vertical height
  of the map.
- For controls that are not bound, the customize controls menu now displays
  a black --- instead of ???.
- Applied Gez's BossBrainPatch3.
- Fixed: P_BulletSlope() did not return the linetarget. This effected
  the Sigil, A_JumpIfCloser, and A_JumpIfTargetInLOS.

June 25, 2008
- Fixed all the new warnings tossed out by GCC 4.3.

June 23, 2008
- Fixed: PickNext/PrevWeapon() did not check for NULL player actors.
- Fixed compilation issues with GCC.
- Removed special case for nobotnodes in MAPINFO.

June 22, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added support for ST's QUARTERGRAVITY flag.
- Added a generalized version of Skulltag's A_CheckRailReload function.
- Fixed: DrawImage didn't take 0 as a valid image index.
- Added Gez's RandomSpawner submission with significant changes.
- Added optional blocks for MAPINFO map definitions. ZDoom doesn't use
  this feature itself but it allows other ports based on ZDoom
  to implement their own sets of options without making such a MAPINFO 
  unreadable by ZDoom.
  
June 16, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The mugshot would not reset on re-spawn.
- Fixed: Picking up a weapon would sometimes not activate the grin.
- Changed: Line_SetIdentification will ignore extended parameters when
  used in maps defined Hexen style in MAPINFO.
- Fixed: Ambient sounds didn't pass their point of origin to S_StartSound.
- Fixed: UseType was not properly set for textures defined in TEXTURES.
- Fixed: You couldn't set an offset for sprites defined in TEXTURES.
- Added read barriers to all actor pointers within player_t except for
  mo, ReadyWeapon and PendingWeapon.

June 15, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a read barrier to player_t::PrewmorphWeapon.
- Fixed: After spawning a deathmatch player P_PlayerStartStomp must
  be called.
- Fixed: SpawnThings must check if the players were spawned before
  calling P_PlayerStartStomp.
- Fixed typo in flat scroll interpolation.
- Changed FImageCollection to return translated texture indices so
  that animated icons can be done with it.
- Changed FImageCollection to use a TArray to hold its data.
- Fixed: SetChanHeadSettings did an assignment instead of comparing
  the channel ID witg CHAN_CEILING.
- Changed sound sequence names for animated doors to FNames.
- Automatically fixed: DCeiling didn't properly serialize its texture id.
- Replaced integers as texture ID representation with a specific new type
  to track down all potentially incorrect uses and remaining WORDs used
  for texture IDs so that more than 32767 or 65535 textures can be defined.

June 14, 2008
- Increased the duration of respawn invulnerability by one second.
- DF2_YES_RESPAWN_INVUL and DF_FORCE_RESPAWN now apply to all multiplayer 
  games, not just deathmatch, without the need for turning on
  alwaysapplydmflags.
- Fixed: DF2_YES_RESPAWN_INVUL only worked in deathmatch, even with
  alwaysapplydmflags turned on.
- Fixed: DF_COOP_LOSE_ARMOR did not empty the starting armor items.
- Replaced the naive area sound implementation with one that takes into
  consideration the size and shape of the sector producing the sound. See
  the lifts on Doom 2 MAP30 and compare with previous versions.

June 14, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The UDMF parser stored plane rotation angles as fixed_t, not angle_t.
- Grouped the sector plane texture transformation values into a separate
  structure and replaced all access to them with wrapper functions.

June 13, 2008
- Fixed: The stop sound for sector-based sound sequences was not played with
  the CHAN_AREA flag.
- Removed the distinction between S_Sound() and S_SoundID() functions. Use
  S_Sound() for both names and IDs from now on.

June 12, 2008
- Add environment 255, 255 as a way to get the software underwater effect in
  any zone you want.
- Using a too-recent version of FMOD now gives an error, since there may be
  breaking changes to the API from one version to the next (excluding
  revisions in stable branches, which only represent bug fixes).
- Updated fmod_wrap.h for FMOD 4.16 and corrected a bug that had gone
  unnoticed before: The delayhi and delaylo parameters for Channel::setDelay()
  and getDelay() were swapped.

June 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: P_ChangeSector could incorrectly block movement when checking for
  mid textures linked to a moving floor.
- Fixed AActor's bouncefactor definitions which I accidentally changed when
  adding wallbouncefactor.
- Fixed: A_SpawnItemEx added the floorclip offset to the z coordinate instead 
  of subtracting it.

June 11, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: SBARINFO's popup code used 1-based indices to address a C++ array.
- Fixed: ACS's ChangeSky command didn't clean up the stack.
- Fixed: Wall scrolling interpolations incremented their reference count twice.
- Fixed: Before a level's thinkers are loaded all previous interpolations must
  be cleared.
- Fixed: deleted interpolations didn't NULL the pointer in the interpolated
  object. Also added all interpolation pointers to DSectorMarker to ensure
  that they are properyl processed by the garbage collector.

June 10, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added scaling to double size for idmypos display.
- Changed: Players don't telefrag when they are spawned now but after all
  actors have been spawned to avoid accidental voodoo doll telefragging.
- Fixed: ACS scripts for non-existent maps were started on the current one.
- Added a 'wallbouncefactor' property to AActor.
- Reverted forceunderwater change from r1026 and fixed the problem for real:
  SECF_FORCEDUNDERWATER only has meaning when coming from the heightsec.
  So the initial check of the current sector in AActor::UpdateWaterLevel
  must only check for SECF_UNDERWATER, not SECF_UNDERWATERMASK.

June 9, 2008
- Dehacked fix discovered by entryway: Dehacked only changes the blue armor's
  armortype. It does not touch the armor given by the megasphere.
- Changed forcewater handling so that only control sectors created by one-
  sided lines become swimmable, since there's a good chance that a two-sided
  line is creating the control sector out of a normal, accessible portion of
  the map. (See e.g. linedef 29242 of zdoomcmp1.)

June 7, 2008
- Added self-modifying code notifications for Valgrind.
  Build with make VALGRIND=1 to turn them on.

June 6, 2008
- Fixed: There was still an inventory bar check in FMugShot::GetFace() after
  separating it from DDoomStatusBar.

June 5, 2008
- Fixed: When following links in S_StartSound(), the function used sfx
  instead of S_Sfx as the array base for getting the NearLimit.
- Repositioned the declaration of the file string in D_DoomMain() so that it
  won't be left on the stack at exit.
- Fixed: PSymbol needs a virtual destructor so that PSymbolActionFunction can
  free its Arguments.
- Symbols for native classes are now freed on exit.

June 4, 2008
- Removed the 8-character limit on endpic names from the parser. (Though it
  might still be present in the texture manager; I don't remember.)
- Fixed: EndSequence needs a proper constructor.

June 4, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The EndSequence structure was not fully initialized.
- While doing the interpolation rewrite I noticed that DScroller and DPolyAction
  were doing some things in their destructor that needed to be done in the
  Destroy method.
- Rewrote the interpolation code. Interpolations are no longer some objects
  that are separate from the rest of the engine. Instead, they are owned by
  the thinkers starting them. Also, polyobjects only spawn a single interpolation
  for each polyobject instead of a single one for each vertex.
  Also, different types of interpolation objects are used for different types
  of interpolation so that they can do some additional work if eventually needed.

June 3, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: MAPINFO's 'lookup' option should only work for actual strings but
  not for lump and file names.
- Added a few 'activator == NULL' checks to some ACS functions.
- Added line and vertex lists to polyobjects so that I can do some 
  changes that won't work with only a seg list being maintained.

June 3, 2008 (SBarInfo update #23)
- Fixed: Drawing the amount of an inventory item in the player's inventory did
  not work
- Added: PowerupTime to drawnumber and drawbar.  You must specify a
  powerupgiver.  Although drawnumber goes in seconds the powerup has left
  drawbar will use ticks for extra accuracy.
- I have increased cross-port compatibility with Skulltag.  If an unknown
  game mode is provided for sbarinfo's gamemode command it will ignore it and
  continue.
  
June 2, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added an option to consider intermission screens gameplay for purposes of
  capturing the mouse.
- Changed: Telefragging should not thrust the victim if it isn't in precisely the
  same position as the killer.
- fixed: A_SpawnItemEx must call P_TeleportMove before checking the spawned
  object's position.

June 1, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Ouch state was far to easy to achieve.
- Made all the basic texture classes local to their implementation.
  They are not needed anywhere else.
- Changed the HackHack hack for corrupt 256 pixel high textures that
  FMultiPatchTexture only calls a virtual function instead of doing any
  type checks of the patch itself.
- Cleaned up the constant definitions in doomdata.h.
- Moved the TEXTUREx structures from doomdata.h to multipatchtexture.cpp
  because they are used only in this one file.
- Removed some more typedefs from r_defs.h and doomdata.h
- Moved local polyobject data definitions from p_local.h to po_man.cpp.
- Renamed player_s to player_t globally to get rid of the duplicate names 
  for this class.
  
May 31, 2008
- Added coordinate range checking to DCanvas::ParseDrawTextureTags() to avoid
  potential crashes in the situation that con_scaletext is 2 and somebody
  uses a hud message as if a hud size was specified, but forgot to actually
  set the hud size.
- Consolidated the mug shot code shared by DSBarInfo and DDoomStatusBar
  into a single place.
- Fixed: Setting an invalid mug shot state crashed the game.
- Fixed my attempts to be clever with strings yesterday.

May 30, 2008
- If an actor's current target temporarily goes unshootable, its threshold
  is now reset to 0, so it will more readily switch back to it.
- Fixed: Deactivating the game no longer allows reverb effects to continue
  playing while the sound is paused.
- Fixed: S_StartNamedSound() looked for SECF_SILENT in MoreFlags instead of
  Flags.
- Fixed: DSBarInfo::updateState() and DDoomStatusBar::UpdateState() sprung
  leaks and didn't allocate enough space for the fullStateName string.
- Disabled DUMB's mono destination mixers. It's not like I'm ever going to
  target an original SoundBlaster, so they're a waste of space to have around.
  This trims resample.obj down to ~60k now.

May 29, 2008
- Fixed: PrtScn/SysRq key did not work on Linux.

May 29, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: The texture loader now looks for a TEXTURES lump for text based
  texture definitions. HIRESTEX is still supported but deprecated.
- Removed all 16 bit values from texture manager.
- Changed: The texture manager now sorts all textures for a WAD by type
  to avoid priority issues with HIRESTEX defined textures.
- Changed sidedef flag WALLF_ADDTRANS into a linedef flag because it is
  always the same for both sides of a linedef. This also makes handling
  this in the UDMF parser easier because the linedef parsing function does
  not need to access the sidedef data.
- Added new ZDoom specific UDMF linedef and sidedef properties to map parser.

May 28, 2008
- Added an alternate module replay engine that uses foo_dumb's replayer, a
  heavily customized version of DUMB (Dynamic Universal Music Bibliotheque).
  It has been slightly modified by me:
  * Added support for Ogg Vorbis-compressed samples in XM files ala FMOD.
  * Removed excessive mallocs from the replay core.
  * Rerolled the loops in resample.c. Unrolling them made the object file
    ~250k large while providing little benefit. Even at ~100k, I think it's
    still larger than it ought to be, but I'll live with it for now.
  Other than that, it's essentially the same thing you'd hear in foobar2000,
  minus some subsong detection features. Release builds of the library look
  like they might even be slightly faster than FMOD, which is a plus.
- Fixed: Timidity::font_add() did not release the file reader it created.
- Fixed: The SF2 loader did not free the sample headers in its destructor.

May 28, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added new ZDoom specific UDMF sector properties to map parser.
- Added class definitions for new interpolators that are better 
  equipped to interact with the interpolated objects.
- Separated interpolation code into its own file r_interpolate.cpp.
- Added some simple customization options to the end game screens.

May 27, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Polyobject detection in the internal node builder did not work 
  anymore due to some code rearrangement for UDMF map loading. To keep
  it compatible between all map formats the THINGS lump of binary format
  maps must be loaded before building the nodes. This also means that
  the spawning itself can be done in the same function for all map types
  (except Build) now.
- Changed 'Smooth mouse movement' menu option from m_filter to smooth_mouse
  which is more what would be expected from this option.
- Fixed: Weapons and ammo items that were modified by Dehacked gave full
  ammo when being dropped by monsters. To properly handle this the
  handling of spawning Dehacked modified pickups was changed to use
  the DECORATE replacement feature instead of hacking the spawn state
  of the original item and calling a spawn function from there.

May 23, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The compatibility searches for teleport destinations did not work
  properly when the teleporter had both a tid and a tag. Now, if a teleporter
  has a tag these are skipped because they are only present for Hexen
  compatibility.
- Fixed: The first texture in a TEXTURE1 lump, although invalid when used
  elsewhere, must be usable as sky (see Requiem.wad's SKY3.)
- Fixed: side_t::GetLightLevel relied on the global 'linedef' variable for
  automatic fake contrast.
- Changed: Fake contrast now uses the WALLF_AUTOCONTRAST globally instead
  of manipulating the sides' light values individually. This allows changing
  the fake contrast at run time and also allows adding individual relative
  lighting on top of it which is a planned UDMF feature.

May 22, 2008
- Fixed: ActorStencilColor() did not set the palette part of the actor's
  fill color, so it would always produce black for STYLE_Shaded.
- Added volume reduction for stereo sounds played in 3D to obtain levels
  closer to FMOD 3, which downmixed all stereo sounds to mono before
  playing them in 3D. Also added experimental 3D spread for stereo sounds
  so that you can actually hear them in stereo.

May 22, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Reworked a few options that previously depended on LEVEL_HEXENFORMAT
  (actors being forced to the ground by instantly moving sectors, strife
  railing handling and shooting lines with a non-zero but unassigned tag.)
  With UDMF such semantics have to be handled diffently. 
- finalized UDMF 1.0 implementation.
- Added Martin Howe's latest morph update.

May 21, 2008
- Fixed: When R_DrawTiltedPlane() calculates the p vector, it can overflow
  if the view is near the bounds of the fixed point coordinate system. This
  happens because it rotates the view position around (0,0) according to
  the current viewangle, so the resultant coordinate may be outside the
  bounds of fixed point. All important math in this function is now done
  entirely in floating point.
- Fixed: Slopes didn't draw right on 64-bit platforms.

May 20, 2008
- Fixed: With hardware 2D, the console and menu need not reimplement palette
  flashes to ensure their visibility.
- Fixed: DFlashFader::Destroy() did not call its super method.
- Fixed: If a player was morphed into a class with a taller view height,
  their perceived view height would not change until they walked up a step.

May 19, 2008
- Since KDIZD is the only mapset I know of that used reverb, and it didn't
  define any new ones of its own, I'm pre-emptively renaming the SNDEAX lump
  to REVERBS to remove any possible misunderstanding that this is something
  that requires EAX hardware support. (Ideally, it would have been REVERBDEF,
  but that's 10 characters long.) The eaxedit console command has also been
  renamed to reverbedit for the same reason.
- Fixed: The Palette part of FRemapTable was not initialized with alpha values
  other than 0. I'm not sure if it would be better to fix this in the game
  palette that it copies from or not, but right now, they get set
  unconditionally to 255.
- Fixed: M_DrawSave() and M_DrawLoad() need to use GetScaledWidth(), in case
  the texture is high-res.
- Replaced all instances of "flags +=" in sbarinfo_parser.cpp with "flags |="
  so that using the same flag multiple times will not have unexpected results.

May 19, 2008 (sbarinfo update #21)
- Added: sigil image type to correctly draw the sigil's icon.
- Added: Strife inventory bar style.  This is the only style that is radically
  different from the others.  First of all it changes the SELECTBO to be
  INVCURS and draws it before the icons.  Each box is changed to have a width
  of 35 pixels instead of 31 pixels.  And the INVCURS graphic is drawn at
  (x-6, y-2).
- Added: whennnotzero flag to drawnumber which will cause it to draw nothing if
  the value is 0.
- Fixed: New mugshot code would not leave the god state when it was supposed to
  enter the rampage state.
- Fixed: The ouch state was mostly broken.

May 18, 2008 (SBarInfo Update #20)
- Added: hasweaponpiece command to check for custom weapon pieces.
- Added: usessecondaryammo command to check if the current weapon has a second
  ammo type.
- Most of SBarInfo's mugshot scripting can be used with the default Doom status
  bar.
- Fixed: By default drawmugshot would never come out of normal god mode state.
  In addition the state change to and from god mode was not quite as responsive
  as the original code.
  
May 17, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: When FTextureManager::CheckForTexture finds a matching NULL texture
  it should always return 0, not the actual texture's index.
- Fixed coordinate checks for objects on 3DMidtex lines.
- Fixed: All translucent blending operations for CopyColors must treat an 
  alpha of 0 so that the pixel is not modified or texture composition as 
  intended will not work.

May 16, 2008
- Fixed: 3D hardware texture filling did not copy pixels with 0 alpha,
  preserving whatever was underneath in the texture box previously.
- Fixed: s_sound.cpp had its own idea of whether or not sounds were paused
  and did not entirely keep it in sync with the sound system's. This meant
  that when starting a new game from the menu, all sounds were played as
  menu sounds until you did something to pause the game, because s_sound.cpp
  thought sounds were unpaused, while the FMOD system thought they were.

May 15, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- I finally managed to test the translucency options for composite texture
  definitions in HIRESTEX. The feature should be complete now.
- Fixed: A_CheckTargetInLOS used BAM angles instead of degrees which is the
  DECORATE convention.
- Added Snowkate709's A_CheckTargetInLOS addition.
- Added listmaps CCMD.

May 14, 2008
- Revised underwater effect now uses a lowpass filter in combination with an
  optional freeverb unit.
- Removed ResetEnvironment hack, since with software reverb, losing the
  existing reverb when focus is lost isn't a problem.
- Commented out the TiMidity FIXME messages.
- Fixed: FBarShader::GetColumn() passed incorrect information to the software
  renderer for horizontal bars.

May 13, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: For actors not being spawned on the floor P_FindFloorCeiling should
  be used to prevent them from dropping through 3DMIDTEX textures.
- Fixed: AMageStaffFX2::IsOkayToAttack overwrote the projectile's angle variable.

May 13, 2008
- Changed the types of object hash indices in FArchive from size_t to DWORD.
  This seems to fix crashes on GCC 64-bit builds when saving games. Not sure
  if it was a GCC bug or my bug, since it worked fine with VC++, but since the
  code that calculates the index only returns a DWORD, storing it as a size_t
  was rather pointless.
- Added the C99 printf size specifiers 't' (ptrdiff_t) and 'z' (size_t) to
  FString::Format() so that I can fix all the problem printf strings that a
  64-bit GCC compile finds.

May 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Skulltag's PUFFGETSOWNER flag.
- Fixed: Parsing sector special bit masks must be done backwards so that later
  definitions take precedence.
- Added base translation tables for UDMF compatibility maps which only should
  handle the native line and sector types of each game.
- Turned the inactive SILENT_INSTANT_FLOORS define into a compatibility option
  so that it can be (un)set in a map definition and the menu.
- Fixed: SPAC_AnyCross didn't work.
- Fixed: Pushable doors must also check for SPAC_MPush.
- Fixed: P_LoadThings2 did not adjust the byte order for the thingid field.

May 11, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: HIRESTEX 'define' textures now replace existing textures
  of type MiscPatch with the same name.
- Added UDMF line trigger types MonsterUse and MonsterPush.
- Separated skill and class filter bits from FMapThing::flags so that
  UDMF can define up to 16 of each. Also separated easy/baby and
  hard/nightmare and changed default MAPINFO definitions.

May 10, 2008
- Fixed: FWadCollection::MergeLumps() did not initialize the flags for any
  marker lumps it inserted.
- Fixed: Need write barriers when modifying SequenceListHead.

May 9, 2008
- Added a new cvar: midi_timiditylike. This re-enables TiMidity handling of
  GUS patch flags, envelopes, and volume levels, while trying to be closer
  to TiMidity++ than original TiMidity.
- Renamed timidity_config and timidity_voices to midi_config and midi_voices
  respectively.

May 9, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: Crosshair drawing uses the current player class's default health instead
  of 100 to calculate the color for the crosshair.
- Added SECF_NOFALLINGDAMAGE flag plus Sector_ChangeFlags to set it. Also separated
  all user settable flags from MoreFlags into their own Flags variable.

May 8, 2008
- Reduced volume, expression, and panning controllers back to 7 bits.
- Added very basic Soundfont support to the internal TiMidity. Things missing:
  filter, LFOs, modulation envelope, chorus, reverb, and modulators. May or
  may not be compatible with TiMidity++'s soundfont extensions.

May 8, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed all thing coordinates that were stored as shorts into fixed_t.
- Separated mapthing2_t into mapthinghexen_t and the internal FMapThing so
  that it is easier to add new features in the UDMF map format.
- Added some initial code to read UDMF maps.

May 6, 2008
- Added support for quoted strings to the TiMidity config parser.

May 2, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Split off the slope creation code from p_Setup.cpp into its own file.
- Separated the linedef activation types into a bit mask that allows combination
  of all types on the same linedef. Also added a 'first side only' flag. This
  is not usable from Hexen or Doom format maps though but in preparation of
  the UDMF format discussed here:
  http://www.doomworld.com/vb/source-ports/43145-udmf-v0-99-specification-draft-aka-textmap/
- Changed linedef's alpha property from a byte to fixed point after seeing that
  255 wasn't handled to be fully opaque.
- fixed a GCC warning in fmodsound.cpp

April 30, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Warped textures didn't work anymore because the default speed was 0.

April 30, 2008
- Fixed: I had instrument vibrato setting the tremolo_sweep_increment value
  in the instrument loader, effectively disabling vibrato.

April 29, 2008
- Fixed: FString::StripRight() stripped the final character of the string if
  there were no designated characters to strip at the end of it.
- Added support for Shoutcast/Icecast playlists.
- Added an error message when a playlist could not be opened.
- Added support for PLS format playlists, in addition to M3U.
- Changed FPlayList to use an array of FStrings.
- Fixed: Playlists required every song to be specified by an absolute path.
- Fixed a copy-and-paste error in win32/i_main.cpp for 64-bit mode.
- Tweaked OPL centering a little.

April 28, 2008
- Added dynamic recentering for the OPL synth. The chip has four basic
  waveforms, and three of them are non-negative. This can cause a tendency
  for the resulting output waveform to go into very high ranges depending on
  the timbres used, and Heretic's exemplify this problem.
- Reduced the OPL volume level slightly.
- Fixed: The waveform view from snd_drawoutput was upside-down.
- Various fixes for compiling working 64-bit binaries with Visual C++. The
  number of changes was pleasantly small, and a cursory check seems to show
  everything working alright.

April 27, 2008
- Separated the skin scale values into separate X and Y values so that skins
  automatically generated for different player classes can use both the
  scaling values that can be set for the actor.

April 26, 2008
- Fixed: Any MIDI ticks that contain only events that are interpreted by
  the MIDI parser and not passed on to the MIDI device would mess up timing
  for future events.
- Changed EMIDI controller 110-113 handling to more accurately match the
  EMIDI specs: Track designations and exclusions should be ignored past
  the initial beat, and EMIDI program change and volume events should be
  ignored unless they were used in the initial beat.
- Fixed: When FMOD::System::init() returns FMOD_ERR_OUTPUT_CREATEBUFFER, it
  could also be because the user selected PCM-Float output, but the driver
  doesn't support it (even if it claims to *cough*Audigy XP drivers*cough*).

April 26, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added speed factors for texture warp commands.
- Added damage type parameter to A_Die.

April 25, 2008
- Re-enabled TiMidity's loop and envelope stripping for instruments that look
  like they weren't really meant to be played by the GUS MIDI library.

April 25, 2008 (SBarInfo Update #18)
- Simplified the DrawGraphic function in sbarinfo_display.cpp
- Added xOffset, yOffset, and alpha to every drawing function in
  sbarinfo_display.cpp.  So Strife popups can be handeled better and allow for
  other effects (translucent bars?).  I'm thinking about making a struct for
  these five (also x and y) arguments so that the argument lists don't become a
  mess.
- Changed DRAWIMAGE in sbarinfo_display.cpp to not use so many calls to
  DrawGraphic.
- DrawKeyBar wasn't using screen->DrawTexture.
- Added a Fade transition for popups.  It takes two args fade in rate and fade
  out rate.  Both are floats (1.0 = 1 tic to complete 0.5 = 2 tics to complete
  and so on).
- Added a translucency arg to statusbars.  1.0 = opaque and 0.0 = invisible.

April 24, 2008
- Fixed: When an instrument's envelope runs out, it does not immediately ramp
  to zero. Rather, it lets the remainder of the sample finish playing.
- Fixed: When playing a MIDI file with EMIDI track designations to turn a
  track off, any ticks that had only events on the disabled track would cause
  the delay for that track to be thrown away, and the following notes on
  enabled tracks would play too soon. This could be heard quite clearly in
  xplasma.mid, where track 4 (FMGlass Drone 1) would interfere with the timing
  of tracks 13 and 14 (EP1 Melody and EP1 Echo).

April 24, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: DFlashFader did some operations in its destructor that had to be moved
  to its Destroy method.
- Fixed: Dropped weapons from dying players should not double ammo.

April 23, 2008
- Fixed: When note_on() is called and another copy of the same note is
  already playing on the channel, it should stop it with finish_note(), not
  kill_note(). This can be clearly heard in the final cymbal crashes of
  D_DM2TTL where TiMidity cuts them off because the final cymbals are played
  with a velocity of 1 before the preceding cymbals have finished. (I wonder
  if I should be setting the self_nonexclusive flag for GUS patches to
  disable even this behavior, though, since gf1note.c doesn't turn off
  duplicate notes.)
- Changed envelope handling to hopefully match the GUS player's. The most
  egregious mistake TiMidity makes is to treat bit 6 as an envelope enable
  bit. This is not what it does; every sample has an envelope. Rather, this
  is a "no sampled release" flag. Also, despite fiddling with the
  PATCH_SUSTAIN flag during instrument loading, TiMidity never actually
  used it. Nor did it do anything at all with the PATCH_FAST_REL flag.

April 23, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: wbstartstruct's lump name fields were only 8 characters long
  and not properly zero-terminated when all 8 characters were used.
- Fixed: Local sound sequence definitions caused a crash because a proper
  NULL check was missing.

April 22, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added translucent blending modes to FMultipatchTexture (not tested yet!)
- Also changed all true color texture creation functions to use proper alpha
  values instead of inverted ones.
- Changed FRemapTable so that all palette entries must contain proper alpha
  values. 
  
April 21, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The F1 screen check in m_menu.cpp was missing a NULL pointer check.
  
April 20, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: The boss brain's explosions play weapons/rocklx which is an 
  unlimited sound. This can become extremely loud. Replaced with a new
  sound which is just an alias to weapons/rocklx but has a limit of 4.

April 19, 2008
- Fixed: MugShotFrame::getTexture() allocated space for the sprite name that
  it never freed. I'm not sure it's a good assumption that 9 characters is
  always long enough, either, since you can have longer file names than that
  inside a zip.
- Fixed: DSBarInfo::DrawGem() crashed if chain or gem was NULL.
- Fixed: Sound sequences are not thinkers, therefore they must be explicitly
  marked as roots for the GC.
- Reduced the range that area sounds require to interpolate between 2D and
  3D panning.
- The listener's velocity is now set at 0 for the sound engine. The player
  moves so fast that you can hear the doppler shift just by running around,
  otherwise.
- Changed the sound code so that all sounds that start playing on a single
  tic actually start playing at the exact same sample position.
- Added the writewave command to write the internal TiMidity's output to a
  wave file.
- Changed the default channel velocity for MUS files from 64 to 100 to
  better match apparent MIDI practice. (Would like to know what this is
  supposed to be.)
- Changed the mus2midi channel assignments to match the internal player's.
- Fixed: apply_envelope_to_amp() should clamp the mix levels to 0.

April 18, 2008
- Made the maximum number of TiMidity voices configurable through the
  timidity_voices cvar.
- Added stats lines for the OPL and Timidity MIDI devices.
- Completely changed the way TiMidity volume calculations are done. It
  should now be extremely close to the output a real GUS would produce with
  its official MIDI player (excepting where TiMidity normalizes sample
  volumes). The new equations more closely match what is specified by the DLS
  and SF2 specs (but not quite), so I presume it's also more musically
  correct than what TiMidity (and TiMidity++) do.

April 18, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: FBlockThingsIterator didn't set the current block coordinates if
  they were outside the blockmap. This could cause extreme delays if an
  iteration started outside the valid boundaries.

April 17, 2008
- Fixed: The music stream needs to zero the FMOD_REVERB_CHANNELPROPERTIES
  before sending it to Channel::getReverbProperties().
- Fixed: The earthquake effect did not play its sound as an actual looping
  sound. I'm a bit surprised this only recently started causing problems.

April 17, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Martin Howe's fixes for morphing and DECORATE function prototypes.
- Minor fixes in texture code.

April 16, 2008
- Fixed: The FMOD::System object was never released, only closed, so
  snd_reset would eventually run into the hard limit on the total number
  of FMOD::System objects that can be created concurrently (currently 15).
- Added proper error checks to the FMOD initialization process.
- Updated fmod_wrap.h for FMOD 4.14.
- Set note velocity back to using a linear sounding volume curve, although
  it's now used to scale channel volume and expression, so recompute_amp()
  is still only doing one volume curve lookup.
- Fixed: TimidityMIDIDevice caused a crash at the end of a non-looping song.

April 16, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Made translation support for multipatch textures operational.

April 15, 2008
- Added support for the GUS patch format's scale_frequency and scale_factor
  parameters. These seem to be used primarily to restrict percussion
  instruments to specific notes.
- Changed note velocity to not use the volume curve in recompute_amp(), since
  this sounds closer to TiMidity++, although I don't believe it's correct
  MIDI behavior. Also changed expression so that it scales the channel volume
  before going through the curve.
- Reworked load_instrument() to be less opaque.
- Went through the TiMidity code and removed pretty much all of the SDL_mixer
  extensions. The only exception would be kill_others(), which I reworked
  into a kill_key_group() function, which should be useful for DLS
  instruments in the future.

April 15, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added translation support to multipatch textures. Not tested yet!
- Added Martin Howe's morph weapon update.
- Changed true color texture creation to use a newly defined Bitmap class
  instead of having the copy functions in the frame buffer class.
- Fixed: The WolfSS didn't have its obituary defined.
- Added submission for ACS CheckPlayerCamera ACS function.
- Removed FRadiusThingsIterator after discovering that VC++ misoptimized
  it in P_CheckPosition. Now FBlockThingsIterator is used with the distance
  check being done manually.

April 14, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added rotation 90� angles only) and mirroring to the Multipatch texture 
  composition code.
- Fixed: The game crashed when a level was ended while a player was morphed
  by a powerup.
- Fixed: A_VileAttack positioned the fire on the wrong side of the target.
- Reorganized the HackHack code so that the image creation was moved into
  MakeTexture. This was necessary because Unload deleted the pixel data
  and broke the whole thing.
- Fixed: FPatchTexture::HackHack and FDoomStatusbarTexture::DrawToBar used the
  obsolete and uninitialized variable Near255. 
- Removed the span creation code specific to FPatchTexture. It only has an
  advantage when the lump has already been loaded in memory but since that
  is no longer the case now the generic version in FTexture is actually better.
- Changed: FTexture::CopyToBlock no longer uses the spans but the pixel buffer
  directly. Since most patches in multipatch textures are non transparent
  the added overhead from creating the spans far outweighs any savings they
  might provide. It is also simpler to handle for mirrored or rotated patches now.
- Changed: Textures only create the spans when really needed. Flats and native
  textures, for example, do not and it only created needless overhead that they
  were always created along with the pixel buffer.
- Made use of player and actor variables consistent in a_hereticweaps.cpp.
- Fixed: A few calls to P_SpawnPlayerMissile passed 0 as angle

April 13, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed a few bugs in the parser for composite textures.
- Changed: When loading Zips all patches in the patches/ directory should
  be loaded, not only those used by a texture in TEXTUREx. 
- Disabled timidity_mastervolume for the internal Timidity again because
  with the altered volume calculation it is no longer needed and the default
  volume is on the same level as OPL and FMOD.

April 12, 2008
- Changed FMOD_INIT_ENABLE_DSPNET use to its replacement from 4.14.00,
  FMOD_INIT_ENABLE_PROFILE. Renamed the corresponding cvar to snd_profile.
- Removed the normalize parameter from SoundStream::Play().
- Disabled the chorus and reverb effects added to SDL_mixer's Timidity,
  because they were probably never tested well, either. Thanks to the bug
  in vc_alloc(), they were never even activated.
- Restored the exact frequency range search that was missing from SDL_mixer's
  verion of select_sample().
- Fixed: vc_alloc(), kill_others(), and note_on() treated Voice::status as a
  bit mask, when it's not. These were changes made to SDL_mixer's Timidity.
- Restored the original Timidity volume equation. The other louder one was
  put in when I didn't realize all channels were mono and many notes sounded
  too quiet because they never completed their attack phase.
- Fixed: FileReader::Gets() acted as if fgets() always read the maximum
  number of characters.
- Fixed: FileReader::Open() did not set FilePos and StartPos to 0.

April 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed the internal Timidity player so that it uses timidity_mastervolume
  because it has the same sound volume issues as the external one.
- Replaced use of stdio in Timidity with FileReader and added the option to read
  from the lump directory. If the main config file is inside the lump directory
  it will assume that everything else is as well. If it is a real file it will be
  assumed that the rest is real files as well.
- Fixed: None of the error returns in read_config_file closed the file being read.
- Added Martin Howe's morph system update.
- Added support for defining composite textures in HIRESTEX. It is not fully tested
  and right now can't do much more than the old TEXTUREx method.
- Added a few NULL pointer checks to the texture code.
- Made duplicate class names in DECORATE non-fatal. There is really no stability
  concern here and the worst that can happen is that the wrong actor is spawned.
  This was a constant hassle when testing with WADs that contain duplicate resources.

April 11, 2008
- Removed some GCC warnings.
- Fixed: MinGW doesn't have _get_pgmptr(), so it couldn't compile i_main.cpp.
- Fixed: MOD_WAVETABLE and MOD_SWSYNTH are not defined by w32api, so MinGW
  failed compiling the new MIDI code.
- Fixed: LocalSndInfo and LocalSndSeq in S_Start() need to be const char
  pointers, since "" is a constant.
- Fixed: parsecontext.h was missing a newline at the end of the file.
- Fixed: Timidity::Channel::mono, rpn, and nrpn were not initialized. In
  particular, this meant that every channel was almost certainly in mono mode,
  which can sound pretty bad if the song isn't meant to be played that way.
- Added bank numbers to the MIDI precaching for Timidity, since I guess I do
  need to care about banks, if even the Duke MIDIs use various banks.
- Fixed: snd_midiprecache only exists in Win32 builds, so gameconfigfile.cpp
  shouldn't unconditionally link against it.
- Fixed: pre_resample() was still disabled, and it left two samples at the end
  of the new wave data uninitialized.
- Moved the xmap table from timidity/tables.cpp to playmidi.cpp. Now I can get
  rid of timidity/tables.cpp, which conflicts in name with the main Doom
  tables.cpp. (And interestingly, VC++ automatically renamed the object file,
  so I wasn't aware of the problem with GCC.)

April 11, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a Gets function to the FileReader class which I planned to use
  to enable Timidity to read its config and sound patches from Zips. 
  I put this on hold though after finding out that the sound quality 
  isn't even near that of Timidity++.
- GCC-Fixes (FString::GetChars() for Printf calls)
- Added a dummy Weapon.NOLMS flag so that Skulltag weapons using this flag
  can be loaded

April 10, 2008
- Changed the MIDIStreamer to send the all notes off controller to each
  channel when restarting the song, rather than emitting a single note off
  event which only has 1 in 127 chance of being for a note that's playing
  on that channel. Then I decided it would probably be a good idea to reset
  all the controllers as well.
- Increasing the size of the internal Timidity stream buffer from 1/14 sec
  (copied from the OPL player) improved its sound dramatically, so apparently
  Timidity has issues with short stream buffers. It's now at 1/2 sec in
  length. However, there seems to be something weird going on with
  corazonazul_ff6boss.mid near the beginning where it stops and immediately
  restarts a guitar on the exact same note.
- Added a new sound debugging cvar: snd_drawoutput, which can show various
  oscilloscopes and spectrums.

April 10, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Eliminated some more global variables (onmobj, DoRipping, LastRipped,
  MissileActor, bulletpitch and linetarget.)

April 9, 2008
- Internal TiMidity now plays music. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound right. :(
- Changed the progdir global variable into an FString.

April 9, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Replaced P_PathTraverse with an FPathTraverse class, rewrote all code using
  P_PathTraverse and got rid of a lot of global variables in the process.
- Simplified the use of the checkarray in FBlockThingsIterator: Since the entire
  game runs single threaded there is no need for multiple check arrays if 
  recursive use occurs. Using the same array with a higher start index is 
  sufficient if the size is reset after finishing using the iterator.

April 9, 2008 (SBarInfo Update #17)
- Fixed: SBarInfo tried to calculate scaled offsets on unscaled status bars.
- Added: createpopup to SBarInfo.  No we don't have custom popups yet.  It only
  defines the transition effect.  Currently none or slideinbottom.
- Made the first argument of DrawMugShot optional (think of it as an overloaded
  function).  The use of the first argument is deprecated due to the event of
  per player class faces.
- More changes from DrawImage to screen->DrawTexture().  I guess I didn't get
  them all just yet.
  
April 8, 2008
- Added the FCriticalSection class in critsec.h to make it easier to
  use critical sections in other places besides the OPL player.
- Reimplemented snd_midiprecache, now for MIDI as well as MUS, and
  defaulting to false.

April 8, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Eliminated all use of global variables used as output for P_CheckPosition
  and P_TryMove. Moved BlockingLine and BlockingMobj into AActor because 
  the global variables can be easily overwritten with certain DECORATE 
  constructs.
- Removed some unnecessary morphing code.
- Fixed some bugs in the HIRESTEX parser.
- Added floating point support and #include and #define tokens to 
  FParseContext  Not used yet.
- replaced the value scanning code in FParseContext::GetToken with
  calls to strtol.
- Changed XlatParseContext::FindToken to do a binary search over the
  valid token names.
- Fixed: The check arrays for BlockThingsIterators were not properly
  freed and each iterator allocated a new one as a result.
- Split the Xlat parser context class into a generic part that can be 
  used for other Lemon-based parsers in the future and a smaller
  Xlat-specific part.
- Changed: P_TeleportMove now always sets BlockingLine to NULL and
  P_FindFloorCeiling doesn't set it at all. The way it was set in 
  PIT_FindFloorCeiling didn't look correct. (Note: It's amazing how
  easy it is to break P_TryMove et.al. with DECORATE if you just know
  which combinations of code pointers will cause problems. This definitely
  needs to be addressed.)
- Changed P_FindFloorCeiling so that it doesn't need global variables 
  anymore. I also moved the code to set the calling actor's information
  into this function because that's all it is used for. This also fixes
  another bug:
- AInventory::BecomePickup called P_FindFloorCeiling to get
  proper position values for the item but never set the item's information
  to the return value of this call.
- Removed the check for Heretic when playing *evillaugh when using the 
  Chaos Device. This sound is not defined by the other games so it won't
  play by default.
- Added MORPH_UNDOMORPHBYTOMEOFPOWER and MORPH_UNDOMORPHBYCHAOSDEVICE flags
  for the morph style so that the special behavior of these two items
  can be switched on and off.
- Added Martin Howe's morph system enhancement.

April 7, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed PT_EARLYOUT from P_PathTraverse because it wasn't used anywhere.
- Rewrote BlockThingsIterator code not to use callbacks anymore.

April 6, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PIT_FindFloorCeiling required tmx and tmy to be set but 
  P_FindFloorCeiling never did that.
- Merged Check_Sides and PIT_CrossLine into A_PainShootSkull.
- Replaced P_BlockLinesIterator with FBlockLinesIterator in all places it was
  used. This also allowed to remove all the global variable saving in
  P_CreateSecNodeList.
- Added a new FBlockLinesIterator class that doesn't need a callback
  function because debugging the previous bug proved to be a bit annoying
  because it involved a P_BlockLinesIterator loop.
- Fixed: The MBF code to move monsters away from dropoffs did not work as 
  intended due to some random decisions in P_DoNewChaseDir. When in the
  avoiding dropoff mode these are ignored now. This should cure the problem
  that monsters hanging over a dropoff tended to drop down.
- Added a NOTIMEFREEZE flag that excludes actors from being affected by
  the time freezer powerup.
- Changed: Empty pickup messages are no longer printed.

April 5, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed secret sector drawing in automap so that lines with the ML_SECRET
  flag are only drawn as part of a secret sector if that secret has already
  been found, even if the option is set to always show secret sectors.
- Added the option to use $ as a prefix to a string table name everywhere in
  MAPINFO where 'lookup' could be specified so that there is one consistent
  way to do it.
- Externalized all default episode definitions. Added an 'optional' keyword
  to handle M4 and 5 in Doom and Heretic.
- Added P_CheckMapData function and replaced all calls to P_OpenMapData that
  only checked for a map's presence with it.
- Added Martin Howe's player statusbar face submission.
- Added an 'adddefaultmap' option for MAPINFO. This is the same as 'defaultmap'
  but keeps all existing information in the default and just adds to it. This
  is needed because Hexen and Strife set some information in their base
  MAPINFO and using 'defaultmap' in a PWAD would override that.
- Fixed: Using MAPINFO's f1 option could cause memory leaks.
- Added option to load lumps by full name to several places:
  * Finale texts loaded from a text lump
  * Demos
  * Local SNDINFOs
  * Local SNDSEQs
  * Image names in FONTDEFS
  * intermission script names
- Changed the STCFN121 handling. The character is not an 'I' but a '|' so
  instead of discarding it it should be inserted at position 124.
- Renamed indexfont.fon to indexfont so that I could remove a special case
  from V_GetFont that was just added for this one font.
- Added a 'dumpspawnedthings' CVAR that enables a listing of all things in 
  the map and the actor type they spawned.

April 5, 2008 (SBarInfo Update #16)
- Added: fillzeros flag for drawnumber.  When set the string will always have
  a length of the specified size and zeros will fill in for the missing places.
  If the number is negative the negative sign will take the place of the last
  digit.
- Added: globalarray type to drawnumber which will display the value in a
  global array with the index set to the player's number.  Untested.
- Added: isselected command to SBarInfo.
- Fixed: Bi and Tri colored numbers didn't work.
- Fixed: Crash when using nullimage as the last image in drawswitchableimage.
- Applied Graf suggestion to include the y coord when calulating heights to fix
  most of the gaps caused by round off errors.  At least for now anyways and it
  is only applied for drawimage.
- SBarInfo inventory bars have been converted to use screen->DrawTexture()

April 4, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Increased limit for demon/melee to 4.
- Fixed: P_CheckSwitchRange accessed invalid memory when testing a one-sided
  line.
- Fixed: P_SpawnPuff assumed that all melee attacks have the same range
  (MELEERANGE) and didn't set the puff to its melee state if the range
  was different. Even worse, it checked a global variable for this so
  the behavior was undefined when P_SpawnPuff was called from anywhere
  else but P_LineAttack. To reduce the amount of parameters I combined
  this information with the hitthing and temporary parameters into one
  flags parameter. Also changed P_LineAttack so that it gets passed
  an additional parameter that specifies whether the attack is a melee
  attack or not and set this to true in all calls that are to be considered
  melee attacks. I couldn't use the damage type because A_CustomPunch
  and A_CustomMeleeAttack allow passing any damage type they want.
- Added a sprite option as an alternative of particles for FX_ROCKET 
  and FX_GRENADE.

April 3, 2008
- Changed the Makefiles that are used by both Linux and MinGW so that msys
  detection occurs only if $OS is Windows_NT. Otherwise, spurious nul files
  are created when compiling on Linux.

April 3, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The minimum parameter count for ACS_Execute and ACS_ExecuteAlways for
  DECORATE was wrong (2 instead of 1.)

April 2, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: Hexen set every cluster to be a hub if it hadn't been defined before
  a level using this cluster. Now it will only do that if HexenHack is true, 
  i.e. when original Hexen format MAPINFOs are parsed. For ZDoom format 
  MAPINFOs it will now be the same as for the other games which means that 
  'hub' has to be declared explicitly.
- Added an Idle state that is entered in place of the spawn state if a monster
  has to return to its inactive state if it can't find any more targets.
- Added MF5_NOINTERACTION flag which completely disables all physics related
  code for any actor with this flag. Mostly useful for particle effects where
  the actors just move a certain distance and then disappear.
- Removed the last remains of the antialias precalculation code from
  am_map.cpp because it was no longer used.
- Fixed: Two-sided lines bordering a secret sector were not drawn in the
  proper color
- Fixed: The automap didn't check ACS_LockedExecuteDoor for its lock color.

April 2, 2008
- Switched sounds local to the listener from head-relative 3D sounds to 2D
  sounds so stereo sounds have full separation. I tried using set3DSpread,
  but that still caused some blending of the channels.
- Changed FScanner so that opening a lump gives the complete wad+lump name
  rather than a generic one, so identifying errors among files that all have
  the same lump name no longer involves any degree of guesswork in
  determining exactly which file the error occurred in.
- Added a check to S_ParseSndSeq() for SNDSEQ lumps with unterminated final
  sequences.
- Fixed: Parts of s_sndseq.cpp that scan the Sequences array need NULL
  pointer checks, in case an improper sequence was encountered during
  parsing but not early enough to avoid creating a slot for it in the array.
- Added support for dumping from RAW/DRO/IMF files, so now anything that
  can be played as OPL can also be dumped.
- Removed the opl_enable cvar, since OPL playback is now selectable as just
  another MIDI device.

April 1, 2008
- Added support for DRO playback and dual-chip RAW playback.

March 30, 2008
- Removed MUS support from OPLMUSSong, since using the OPLMIDIDevice with
  MUSSong2 works just as well. There are still lots of leftover bits in
  the class that should probably be removed at some point, too.
- Added dual-chip dumping support for the RAW format.
- Added DosBox Raw OPL (.DRO) dumping support. For whatever reason,
  in_adlib calculates the song length for this format wrong, even though
  the exact length is stored right in the header. (But in_adlib seems buggy
  in general; too bad it's the only Windows version of Adplug that seems to
  exist.)
- Rewrote the OPL dumper to work with MIDI as well as MUS.

March 30, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: When the screen is being deleted the 'screen' variable should be
  set to NULL before performing the delete. Otherwise, in some abnormal
  situations, it could happen that the destroyed screen object is still
  being accessed.
- Fixed: V_Shutdown didn't set OF_YesReallyDelete before deleting screen.
- Fixed: The HIRESTEX parser didn't check if a graphic specified in a remap
  command actually existed.
- Fixed: My $Limit fix from yesterday didn't work because NearLimit was
  an unsigned byte and the comparisons with -1 didn't work. Made it a
  signed word instead.
- Made sfxinfo_t::Link an unsigned int because it limited the amount of 
  usable sounds to 65535.

March 29, 2008
- Fixed: OPLMIDIDevice sent the wrong pitch wheel value to the player code.
  Missimp.mid sounds a lot better now, though still a little off.
- Fixed: MIDI files that had ticks with nothing but meta-events did not play
  properly. (fixes sonic3_finalboss.mid)
- Applied Const's Makefile.linux changes.
- Made the OPL MIDI synth available from Linux.

March 29, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added SnowKate709's A_DamageMaster/A_DamageChildren patch.
- Added a SFX_TRANSFERAMBUSHFLAG for A_SpawnItemEx.
- Added "Shaded" as a valid parameter for DECORATE's RenderStyle.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for a MAPINFO option making Strife conversations
  not halt the game.
- Extended the $limit fix that $alias and $random definitions can have their
  own $limit now.
- Fixed: When resolving a linked sound the limit of the current sound was
  ignored and the one of the referenced sound being used. This was particularly
  noticable when using the chaingun in a group of Zombiemen.
- Added a namespc parameter to FWadCollection::CheckNumForFullName which is
  used when a normal lump name has to be looked up and changed all
  CheckNumForFullName/CheckNumForName combinations in the source to use
  the extended version of CheckNumForFullName only to have consistent
  behavior for lump name lookup.

March 28, 2008
- Moved sound sample rate, buffer size, and buffer count to the
  advanced sound options menu. Removed opl_enable from the menu.
- Added OPL synth as MIDI device -3. Since this is based on the MUS player
  code, it only supports those events and controllers supported by MUS.
  Some of Duke's MIDIs sound awful, but I think that may be more because
  it's using different instruments... There's a thread in the MIDI streamer
  class that could be taken out for Linux, since it doesn't need to deal
  with the Windows Multimedia API, but for now, this is still Windows-only.
- Changed the output of the OPL emulator from 32-bit integers to 32-bit
  floats, so I can write its output directly to the stream buffer. In
  addition, this lets me bring the OPL volume level much closer to the
  standard MIDI volume.

March 27, 2008
- Did some restructuring of the OPL code in preparation for turning it
  into a general MIDI player.
- Fixed: Passing false for a stream callback did not stop the stream.
- Removed opl_frequency, since the only time the emulation sounds good is
  when it plays at the exact frequency of a real chip.
- Music no longer plays at all when snd_musicvolume is 0.
- Bumped up snd_sfxvolume and snd_musicvolume default values.
- Changed D3DFB to explicitly request double buffering instead of assuming
  that the drivers will treat a BackBufferCount of 0 as a request for
  double buffering.
- Fixed: Unsetting a cvar did not remove it from the list of tab
  completions.
- Added "" as a synonym for "nullimage" in SBARINFO.
- Fixed: MAKESAVESIG's stringifier in version.h did not work as expected.
  It stringified the passed macro name, not the value of the macro.
- Moved DCajunMaster off the DObject hierarchy.
- Changed DCajunMaster::getspawned into a TArray of FStrings. It was
  mysteriously being left pointing to uninitialized memory during the
  final GC at exit and crashing.
- Fixed: The code that removed hexdd.wad from the list of IWADs when
  hexen.wad was not present did not work.

March 27, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: DCajunMaster::End was missing a write barrier for getspawned. The
  same problem in D_DoomMain.
- Made bglobal a pointer because it was causing problems with the garbage 
  collector.

March 26, 2008
- Added uppercase copies of the IWAD names to the IWAD search for Unix land.
- Added FMOD_OPENONLY to the callback version of CreateStream() to prevent it
  from doing prebuffering of the song. This was causing the Linux version to
  hang while waiting for input from the pipe, since Timidity hadn't been
  started yet. I tried using a select call in the FillStream() method, but it
  always seems to return the pipe as having nothing available. Unfortunately,
  the game still falls all over itself if Timidity isn't available. Instead
  of execvp failing nicely, X errors kill the game. I don't know why it's
  doing that. My advice for Linux music: Skip Timidity++ and get a DLS patch
  set (/WINDOWS/system32/drivers/gm.dls is probably the most common by far)
  and set the snd_midipatchset cvar to point to it. It's faster and also
  sounds a whole lot better than the crappy freepats Ubuntu wants to install
  with Timidity++ (thank goodness I have the official patches from a real
  GUS so I don't need to use them).
- GCC fixes.

March 26, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: After starting new music the music volume has to be reset so that
  the song's relative volume takes effect.
- Removed the arbitrary 1024 bytes limit when the file being played is a MIDI
  file. I had a D_DM2TTL that's only 990 bytes.
- Restructured I_RegisterSong so that $mididevice works again and also supports
  selecting FMOD.
- Added Jim' Linux fix.
- Added MartinHowe's fix for mugshot display in status bars.

March 25, 2008
- The garbage collector is now run one last time just before exiting the game.
- Removed movie volume from the sound menu and renamed some of the other
  options to give the MIDI device name more room to display itself.
- Moved the midi device selection into the main sound menu.
- Added FMOD as MIDI device -1, to replace the MIDI mapper. This is still the
  default device. By default, it uses exactly the same DLS instruments as the
  Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth. If you have another set DLS level 1 patch set
  you want to use, set the snd_midipatchset cvar to specify where it should
  load the instruments from.
- Changed the ProduceMIDI function to store its output into a TArray<BYTE>.
  An overloaded version wraps around it to continue to supply file-writing
  support for external Timidity++ usage.
- Added an FMOD credits banner to comply with their non-commercial license.
- Reimplemented the snd_buffersize cvar for the FMOD Ex sound system. Rather
  than a time in ms, this is now the length in samples of the DSP buffer.
  Also added the snd_buffercount cvar to offer complete control over the
  call to FMOD::System::setDSPBufferSize(). Note that with any snd_samplerate
  below about 44kHz, you will need to set snd_buffersize to avoid long
  latencies.
- Reimplemented the snd_output cvar for the FMOD Ex sound system.
- Changed snd_samplerate default to 0. This now means to use the default
  sample rate.
- Made snd_output, snd_output_format, snd_speakermode, snd_resampler, and
  snd_hrtf available through the menu.
- Split the HRTF effect selection into its own cvar: snd_hrtf.
- Removed 96000 Hz option from the menu. It's still available through the
  cvar, if desired.
- Fixed: If Windows sound init failed, retry with DirectSound. (Apparently,
  WASAPI doesn't work with more than two speakers and PCM-Float output at the
  same time.)
- Fixed: Area sounds only played from the front speakers once you got within
  the 2D panning area.

March 25, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's submission for multiplayer Strife conversations.
- Increased the limit for 'imp/active' to 6. This sound definitely benefits  
  from a higher limit.
- Fixed: $limit should not apply to sounds played from the menu.
- Fixed: The SNDSEQ parser tried to set bDoorSound before actually creating
  the sound sequence data.
- Changed Lemon so that it always writes the header. It still kept recompiling
  the grammar over and over again once it had been changed locally.
- Fixed: ANIMATED allowed animations between different texture types.
- Added a debuganimated CCMD that can be used to output some information
  if a WAD shows broken animations.

March 24, 2008
- Removed xlat_parser.h from the repository. Lemon was always being run on
  xlat_parser.y because both files had the same time stamp after an update,
  and Lemon only rewrites the header file if it's changed.
- Added $volume SNDINFO command. This is multiplied with the volume the sound
  is played at to arrive at the final volume (before distance attenuation).
- Added the CHAN_AREA flag to disable 3D panning within the min distance of a
  sound. Sector sound sequences (except doors) use this flag.
- Added the CHAN_LOOP flag to replace the S_Looped* sound functions.
- Restored the sound limiting.

March 24, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: THe handling for enum values in Xlat was incorrect. The rule with 
  value assignment must set the counter one higher than the current value.
- Fixed: The definition of enums in the Xlat grammar was right-recursive
  which could create stack overflows in the parser. Made it left-recursive as
  recommended in Lemon's docs. 
- Added Thomas's submissions for decal assignment to puffs and NOINFIGHTING flag.
- Reverted changes of r715 in v_collection.cpp because they broke loading
  of status bar face graphics belonging to skins.
SBARINFO update #15
- Fixed: Monospacing fonts wasn't quite correct.
- Fixed: The new mug shot code forgot to use the first arg of drawmugshot (the
  one that picks the default sprite prefix).
- Added: lowerHealthCap variable to SBarInfo, which is set to true by default.
- Added: ininventory event to SBarInfo to detect if one or two items are in (or
  not in) the player's inventory.
- Added: The ability to print global vars using drawnumber.  I need someone to
  test it though.
- Added: aspectratio command to detect what the user's aspect ratio is.
- Added: missing spacing argument to drawstring.
- Changed the sbarinfo display routine for drawnumber to not use cmd.value to
  store what it is about to display.  Now it uses a new variable.
- More conversions from DrawImage to screen->DrawTexture.  I think only the
  inventory bar drawing functions have to be changed now.

March 23, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Sequence pointer in ASoundSequenceSlot was not declared as
  a pointer and it was missing both read and write barriers.
- Fixed: The sector translators must clear unused bits because they might
  render a sector's special inoperable.
- Expanded the args for MAPINFO special actions to 32 bit integers as in
  the rest of the game.
- Fixed: The specialaction list was not copied properly when transferred
  from the defaultinfo.
- Fixed: The defaultinfo for MAPINFO wasn't cleared fully after MAPINFO
  parsing was completed.
- Made Doom-format linedef translators a map property so that it's easier
  to define replacements or extensions.

March 22, 2008
- Changed MIDI playback to not bother playing super short songs that don't
  contain enough music to fill the initial output buffers.
- Removed the read barrier around ADehackedPickup::RealPickup. If the real
  pickup is picked up, it may very well destroy itself before the dehacked
  wrapper's stubs that use it are called.
- Reverted revision 840. For a file we don't want end users to be touching,
  making DEHSUPP plain text sends out mixed messages: "Don't mess with this.
  Oh, by the way, it's plain text now to make it easier for you to edit."
  Is there some reason other than a desire to do away with binary lumps to
  make the distributed lump text?
- Added a new speakermode for Stereo + HRTF: "Headphones". This is the only
  way to get the HRTF low pass filter effect now.
- Fixed: No more than one sector could make noise at once.
- Trying out sound without varying priorities again. 
- Fixed: Need to use setSpeakerMix to let 2D sounds (aka streamed music) use
  their full volume range.

March 22, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added sector type translation to xlat_parser and removed the old sectorx
  lump.
- Added Line_SetTextureOffset special.
- Added 'allowprotection' keyword to terrain definitions to allow damaging
  flats that don't damage players with a radiation suit.
- Fixed: SNDINFO rolloff setting for Strife was missing.
- Added more options to Light_ForceLightning: Setting the first arg to 0
  will behave as before, setting it to 1 will create exactly one lighting
  and setting it to 2 will terminate lightning for the current level
  completely. And it will also work on maps that don't have lightning set
  in MAPINFO now.
- Added: Sector movement that causes deep water to change its height now
  will trigger associated sector actions and adjust the actor's water level.
- Fixed: The serializer for side_t::part never read the texture information
  from a savegame.
- Fixed: side_t::StopInterpolation called setinterpolation instead of
  stopinterpolation. Also moved the clearinterpolation call in 
  P_SetupLevel after the P_FreeLevelData to make absolutely sure that
  nothing in there can leave an interpolator behind by accident.
- Applied Linux fixes by Jim.
SBARINFO update by Blzut3:
- Fixed: the playerclass command needed a null pointer check to prevent
  crashing on respawn.
- Fixed: Mug Shot states were not reset on respawn.
- Removed keepoffsets flag since apparently it was keeping the offsets by
  default.  The means that the only thing not affected by the offsets was using
  nullimage as a background.  Since I wasn't able to get a result I liked I'm
  going to say that if you want a black background with high res positioning
  you will have to create your own bar image.  Maybe I'll fix it some other
  time.
- Added: monospacefonts variable which allows for all of the fonts to be
  monospaced by a specified character (from their fontset of corse).
- Made SBarInfo recognize the bar names for the Strife popups but they don't
  do anything beyond that.  The names are: popuplog, popupkeys, and popupstatus.
- Started converting the drawing routine to be more flexable towards high
  resolution status bars.  (Only did one call so far.)
  
March 21, 2008
- Fixed: Actor-less sounds that aren't played on CHAN_AUTO should still be
  subject to channel overriding.
- Re-added priority selection based on sound usage.
- Reduced the number of virtual channels to match the number of real
  channels.
- Added customizable rolloff, including Doom's standard linear gain rolloff.
  SNDINFO commands are:
    $rolloff <sound> <min distance> <max distance>          -- linear gain (like Doom)
    $rolloff <sound> linear <min distance> <max distance>   -- linear volume
    $rolloff <sound> log <min distance> <rolloff factor>    -- logarithmic
    $rolloff <sound> custom <min distance> <max distance>   -- use SNDCURVE lump
  Anything closer than min distance is full volume and anything further than
  max distance is inaudible. Logarithmic rolloff does not have a maximum
  distance; it has a scalar that controls how quickly the volume drops off
  instead.

March 21, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Disabled scrolling of 3DMIDTEX textures. Due to the special needs this 
  cannot work properly.
- Added new Scroll_Wall special to allow more control over wall scrolling.
  Since it uses fixed point parameters it can only be used in scripts though.
- Added flags parameters to all wall scroller specials that didn't use
  all 5 args.
- Separated scrolling of the 3 different texture parts of a sidedef.
  While doing this I did some more restructuring of the sidedef structure
  and changed it so that all state changes to sidedefs that affect rendering 
  have to be made with access functions. This is not of much use to the
  software renderer but it allows far easier caching of rendering data
  for OpenGL because the only place I need to check is in the access functions.
- Added Karate Chris's ThingCountSector submission.
- Made texture indices in FSwitchDef full integers. Since that required
  some data restructuring I also eliminated the MAX_FRAMES limit of 128
  per switch.

March 20, 2008
- Removed some debug output from SBarInfo::ParseSBarInfo().
- Fixed: Heretic linetype translations included the wrong file.
- Removed all 2D sound positioning code from s_sound.cpp. Everything uses
  FMOD's 3D engine now.
- Removed all the channel selection code from s_sound.cpp. FMOD has code to
  handle this sort of thing, so let's use it.
- Replaced S_StopSoundID() with S_CheckSingular(). There is no longer a limit
  on the number of copies of a particular sound that can be playing at once,
  aside from Strife's special singular sounds. (Sorry, Heretic and Hexen.)
  Consequently, the SNDINFO $limit command is now ignored.
- Removed ATTN_SURROUND, since FMOD Ex doesn't exactly support it, and it
  only worked as intended on stereo speakers anyway.
- Cleaned out ancient crud from i_sound.cpp.

March 20, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: A_CustomMissile with aimmode 2 ignored spawnofs_xy.
- Changed savegame versioning so that the written version is never lower
  than the minmum one reported as compatible. 
- Added mirrored movement modes for linked sectors.
- Added Eternity-style initialization for linked sectors as a new subtype
  of Static_Init.
- Added linked sectors. The control sector determines how they move but if
  any one of the linked sectors is blocked, movement for all linked sectors
  will be affected. This will allow lifts consisting out of more than one
  sector without the risk of breaking them if only one of the sectors is
  blocked.
- Fixed: A_Mushroom created an actor on the stack.

March 19, 2008
- Fixed: lempar.c needs to specify the __cdecl calling convention for malloc
  and free under VC++.
- Fixed: The source no longer built with GCC.

March 19, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a new parameter to all crushing action specials that selects
  which crushing mode is used: 0 uses the game's default for compatibility,
  1 uses Doom's mode (crushers continue to move while damaging any actors ) and
  2 uses Hexen's mode (crushers stay at blocking actor's top until they die).
  Since Generic_Crusher already used all 5 args I created a second version for
  Hexen crushing mode.
- Added PICKUP flag to DECORATE.
- Integrated xlatcc into ZDoom.exe so that the linedef translation files
  don't need to be compiled and can be stored as text in zdoom.pk3.
- Removed thingdef_specials.h and thingdef_specials.gperf and replaced
  line special definition with something that automatically gets updated
  if new specials are added.
- Added copyright/license headers to a few files.
- Fixed: ACS SetMugShotState needs to check the StatusBar pointer for the
  proper object type.
- Move SBarInfo loading code in d_main.cpp into a static method of DSBarInfo.
- Removed dobject.err from the repository. It only contained a list of compiler
  errors for some very old version of dobject.cpp.
- Fixed: A_JumpIfCloser was missing a z-check.
- Added Blzut3's SBARINFO update #13:
  - Split sbarinfo.cpp into two files sbarinfo_display.cpp and sbarinfo_parser.cpp
  - Rewrote the mug shot system for SBarInfo to allow for scripting and custom
    states for different means of death.
  - SBarInfo now loads all SBarInfo lumps instead of just the last one.  Clashing
    status bar definitions will now be cleared before the bar is read.
  - Fixed: When using transparency with bars the new drawing method (bg over fg)
    didn't work.  In the case that the border value is set to 0 it will revert to
    the old method (fg over bg).
  - Fixed: drawbar lost any high res information it was given.
  - Added: ACS command SetMugShotState(str state) which sets the mug shot state
    for the activating player.
  - Added: keepoffsets flag to drawbar.  When set the offsets in the fg image will
    also be applied when displaying the bar.

March 18, 2008
- Added a cheap pitch shifting for underwater environments that should be fairly
  close to Duke's. It sounds okay for some sounds, but others like the BFG, where
  the timing of the sound actually matters, don't sound good. I shall have to
  replace it with a real pitch shifter DSP unit.
- Removed hardware 3D sound support, since software is cooler.
- Fixed the TArray serializer declaration.
  (Thank you for your warnings, GCC! ;-)
- Changed root sector marking so that it can happen incrementally.

March 18, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- VC++ doesn't seem to like the TArray serializer so I added a workaround
  to be able to save the 3dMidtex attachment info.
- Fixed: The TArray serializer needs to be declared as a friend of TArray
  in order to be able to access its fields.
- Since there are no backwards compatibility issues due to savegame version
  bumping I closed all gaps in the level flag set.
- Bumped min. Savegame version and Netgame version for 3dMidtex related
  changes.
- Changed Jump and Crouch DMFlags into 3-way switches:
  0: map default, 1: off, 2: on. Since I needed new bits the rest of
  the DMFlag bit values had to be changed as a result.
- fixed: PTR_SlideTraverse didn't check ML_BLOCKMONSTERS for sliding
  actors without MF3_NOBLOCKMONST.
- Added MAPINFO commands 'checkswitchrange' and 'nocheckswitchrange'
  that can enable or disable switch range checking globally per map.
- Changed ML_3DMIDTEX to force ML_CHECKSWITCHRANGE.
- Added a ML_CHECKSWITCHRANGE flag which allows checking whether the 
  player can actually reach the switch he wants to use.
- Made DActiveButton::EWhere global so that I can use it outside thr
  DActiveButton class.

March 17, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed P_LineOpening to pass its result in a struct instead of global
  variables.
- Added Eternity's 3DMIDTEX feature (no Eternity code used though.)
  It should be feature complete with the exception of the ML_BLOCKMONSTERS
  flag handling. That particular part of Eternity's implementation is
  sub-optimal because it hijacks an existing flag and doesn't seem to make
  much sense to me. Maybe I'll implement it as a separate flag later.

March 17, 2008
- Fixed: The botinfo field of DCajunMaster was improperly listed as an object
  pointer.

March 16, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: FreshThinkers's max. index is MAX_STATNUM so the code shouldn't
  to access FreshThinkers[MAX_STATNUM+1].

March 15, 2008
- Fixed: The only time bestslideline is ever NULL is before it ever gets set.
  That means my P_BounceWall() "fix" from March 6 wasn't really a working fix.
- Fixed: If an object is flagged for euthanization while it's in the gray
  list, it should just be ignored during the propagation stage.
- After sleeping on it and realizing what was really going in, I generalized
  the inventory fix from the 13th: The actor is flagged by Destroy(), then it
  is later inserted into the thinker list by DThinker::SerializeAll(). So
  rather than unlinking the skipped player from their inventory, just make
  sure any flagged thinkers aren't inserted into a list.
- Fixed: FCanvasTextureInfo::Viewpoint needed a read barrier, and the whole
  list should serve as a root.

March 14, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: A_PainShootSkull was missing a NULL pointer check for the spawn type.
- implemented Vavoom's vertex height things (1504, 1505) that can explicitly
  define slopes for triangular sectors. The height is specified as the thing's
  z-coordinate.

March 14, 2008
- Reimplemented SPC playback as a custom codec for FMOD.
- Removed spc_frequency, because snes_spc only supports the SPC's native
  frequency of 32000 Hz.

March 13, 2008
- Fixed: When returning to a hub map, inventory belonging to the temporary
  copies of the players stored in the archive would be destroyed and break
  apart the STAT_INVENTORY thinker list. Now they aren't destroyed while
  loading the archive but are unlinked from the inventory list instead, so
  the garbage collector will get them later.
- Changed pointer substitution to return the number of pointers changed.

March 13, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Pointer substitution changed the pointers for the thinker ring list
  resulting in a freeze.

March 12, 2008
- Fixed: DACSThinker::ActiveThinker was missing a read barrier.
- Loading a save game now initiates a collection.
- Added a finalization cost to the sweep stage.
- Fixed: D_dehacked.cpp/PatchThing() allocated an actor on the stack.
- Changed the sentinels in the thinker lists into proper thinkers. The old
  way wasn't playing well with the write barriers.
- Fixed: DFrameBuffer::WriteSavePic needs to fix the canvas in place while
  using it.
- Fixed: The sound system was updated every frame, which is a complete waste
  of time. Doing it only once each tic is quite sufficient, since nothing
  really moves between tics, even if the display makes it look otherwise.

March 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The SimpleCanvas in FCanvasTexture must be declared as a soft
  root to the garbage collector.
- Changed DObject's pointer substitution so that the pointers inside an
  object are handled by a virtual function. This allows subclasses to
  implement their own handling if they need it.
- Bumped the minimum savegame version because the current version crashes
  each time an old savegame is loaded.

March 11, 2008
- Removed lots of spc_* cvars that are no longer meaningful and changed
  spc_amp from a x.4 fixed point number to a normal float.
- Switched SPC playback from the external SNESAPU.DLL to Blargg's LGPL
  snes_spc library. I've compiled it with the fast DSP rather than the
  highly accurate one, since I didn't notice a meaningful difference between
  the two in my limited testing. In short: SPC playback is now built in to
  ZDoom. You don't need to download anything extra to make it work, and it
  also works on Linux as well as Windows (though building with Linux is
  currently untested).
- Fixed: Stereo separation was calculated very wrongly when in 2D sound mode.

March 10, 2008
- EAX is a pain in the butt to get it to work reliably. Why? I can get the
  reverb to work just fine with software, but with hardware, I hear nothing
  special at all.
- Fixed: Sounds apparently don't default to location 0,0,0 so I need to set
  that explicitly for 2D sounds in 3D mode.
- Fixed: I had forgotten to actually set the head relative flag for 2D sounds
  played in 3D.
- Fixed: Reverb was applied to digital music in software 3D mode. I tried
  turning off reverb for 2D sounds too, but that turned it off for _all_
  subsequent sounds and not that specific channel.

March 9, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: StreamSong::SetPosition required a NULL pointer check.
- fixed: The release build still linked to the old FMOD version.
- fixed: SPCSong only works for Win32 so its definition must be excluded for Linux.

March 8, 2008
- Fixed: If you wanted to make cleandep with MinGW, you had to specifically
  specify Makefile.mingw as the makefile to use.
- Added a normalizer to the OPL synth. It helped bring up the volume a little,
  but not nearly as much as I would have liked.
- Removed MIDI Mapper references. It doesn't work with the stream API, and
  it doesn't really exist on NT kernels, either.
- Reworked music volume: Except for MIDI, all music volume is controlled
  through GSnd and not at the individual song level.
- Removed the mididevice global variable.
- Added back support for custom streams.

March 7, 2008
- I think the new FMOD Ex code should support everything the old FMOD 3 code
  did, sans custom streaming sounds.
- Removed snd_midivolume. Now that all music uses a linear volume scale,
  there's no need for two separate music volume controls.
- Increased snd_samplerate default up to 48000.
- Added snd_format, defaulting to "PCM-16".
- Added snd_speakermode, defaulting to "Auto".
- Replaced snd_fpu with snd_resampler, defaulting to "Linear".
- Bumped the snd_channels default up from a pitiful 12 to 32.
- Changed snd_3d default to true. The new cvar snd_hw3d determines if
  hardware 3D support is used and default to false.
- Removed the libFLAC source, since FMOD Ex has native FLAC support.
- Removed the altsound code, since it was terribly gimped in comparison to
  the FMOD code. Its original purpose was to have been as a springboard for
  writing a non-FMOD sound system for Unix-y systems, but that never
  happened.
- Finished preliminary FMOD Ex support.

March 6, 2008
- Fixed: If P_BounceWall() can't find a wall when it does its trace, but it
  was entered because a line blocked the projectile, then it should still use
  that blocking line for the bounce.
- The full master volume SysEx is now always sent to the MIDI device, even if
  it seems to have a working volume control.
- Renamed music_midi_stream.cpp to music_midi_base.cpp.
- Moved the WinMM MIDI code into a new container class.
- Fixed: StatusBar and screen need to be barriered, because they are roots
  but can also change at runtime.
- Fixed: Objects that are forcibly deleted outside the GC need to be removed
  from the gray list too.

March 5, 2008
- Fixed: Thinkers needed write barriers when they were removed from their
  lists.
- Fixed: DLevelScript::Link() and Unlink() needed write barriers.

March 4, 2008
- Moved the identical code between the MUS and MIDI streamers into a new base
  class so that all the low-level details of MIDI streaming are kept in
  one place.
- Converted the SMF MIDI playback to use the same MIDI streams as MUS
  playback.
- Moved MUS playback back into its own thread so that it can continue
  uninterrupted if the main thread is too busy to service it in a timely
  manner.
- Fixed: The MEVT_* values are not defined shifted into their spot for a
  MIDIEVENT, so I need to do it myself.
- Fixed: Pausing a MUS and then changing snd_midivolume caused the paused
  notes to become audible.

March 3, 2008
- Changed MUS playback to use MIDI streams, like it did during the early days
  of ZDoom, except now the entire song isn't prebuffered in large chunks, so
  I can insert MIDI events into the playback with fairly low latency. This
  should offer more precise timing than the combination of low-level MIDI and
  WaitForMultipleObjects timeouts that it replaces.
- Fixed: PTR_BounceTraverse only checked for projectiles that were too
  high to pass through two-sided lines, but not ones that were too low.
- Fixed: SBARINFO couldn't detect the extreme death damage type for the
  player face animation.

March 1, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: A_CountdownArg used 0 based indices although all uses of it assumed
  it is 1-based.
- added MF5_DONTRIP flag.
- added CheckActorFloorTexture, CheckActorCeilingTexture and
  GetActorLightLevel ACS functions.
- added IF_ADDITIVETIME flag to create powerups that add their duration
  to the one of the currently active item of the same type.
- fixed: bouncecount wasn't decreased when bouncing on walls.
- Added MF5_ALWAYSRESPAWN and MF5_NEVERRESPAWN flags that selectively
  enable or disable monster respawning regardless of skill setting.
- Prettified deprecated flag handling.
- Fixed: When starting a level while the music has been paused S_Start has 
  to stop the old music so the new one always starts at the beginning.
- Fixed:: AActor::master was not serialized.
- Fixed: Sound targets pointing to dead players should be cleared before 
  respawning the player.
- Fixed: When the DONTMOVE flag is set A_Chase must not call P_NewChaseDir.
- Changed PowerupGiver initialization so that the actual powerup class is looked
  up during postprocessing.
- Gave Strife's instant death sector type its own damage type.

February 29, 2008
- Changed the default GC parameters to make it run more aggressively.
- Added NULL checks to the GC::WriteBarrier() wrappers.
- Fixed: The DObject destructor set GC::SweepPos incorrectly if it pointed
  at that object being deleted.
- Added "soft roots" to the garbage collector. These are similar in
  purpose to setting the OF_Fixed bit, but they behave as full-fledged roots
  as far as the collector is concerned, so any objects reachable through
  them will not be collected.
- Added support for the OF_Fixed bit. This is ONLY for simple objects which
  do not contain pointers to other objects, because all it does is prevent
  an object that is otherwise dead from being freed. It does not include
  the object in the propagate stage if it is unreachable, so any objects
  that are only reachable through it will still be freed unless they are
  also fixed.
- Fixed: R_SetupAddClampCol() checked add4cols' memory instead of
  adclamp4cols' memory when deciding if it should skip modification.

February 28, 2008
- Fixed: The colormap changes by column, so the assembly rt_* routines need
  to be setup for every column group, not once per image.
- Fixed: rt_Translate1col() had a couple of bugs.

February 27, 2008
- Added assembly versions of rt_add4cols and rt_addclamp4cols.
- Added a read barrier to FArchive::SerializeObject() to make sure that
  objects that are being euthanized are not stored in the archive.

February 26, 2008
- Added an assembly version of rt_shaded4cols, since that's the main decal
  drawing function. The most improvement came from being able to turn some
  constant variables into immediate values with self-modifying code, but I
  also managed to reorder it to make it a little faster. It's about 9% faster
  than VC++'s code and 19% faster than GCC's code. That's not a huge
  improvement (for VC++), but at least it's measurable.
- Removed the solid fill "optimization" from rt_shaded4cols(), because in my
  testing, it didn't help any and in fact, hurt just a little bit.
- In the name of simplification, all the rt_tlate* drawers were changed to do
  the translation in one step and the drawing in another. This lets me call
  the untranslated drawer to do the real drawing instead of mostly duplicating
  them. Performance wise, there is practically no difference from before.
- Fixed: Using +stat from the command line caused a crash.
- More write barriers and pointer declarations. Here are rules I've come up
  with so far for when write barriers can be ommitted:
  * Initializing pointers for a newly created object: A new object can never
    be black, so none of its pointers that get set by the constructor (or code
    just following its creation) need to be  behind write barriers.
  * Creating a new thinker and storing it in a pointer: The thinker
    constructor already puts it behind a write barrier when it links it into
    the thinker list, so you don't need to do it again.
  * As a corollary of the above: No pointers to thinkers should need to be
    behind write barriers, because it is incorrect to have a thinker that is
    live but not in a thinker list. I realized this while I was going through
    the long list of actor target references, so there are some write barriers
    for those in place already, since they don't hurt to have them around.
  As a consequence of the last point, I think I'm done placing write barriers
  in all their necessary places without even touching most of the code. I'm
  going to let it sit like this for a few days to see if I can think of a
  counter-example where a live thinker wouldn't be in a thinker list, but it
  feels correct to me right now.

February 25, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The DECORATE expression evaluator's random function could produce
  incorrect results for ranges > 255. Changed so that FRandom's default
  implementation is used instead.

February 24, 2008
- Fixed: DDecalFader::Tick() still referenced TheDecal even after destroying
  it.
- Added write barriers around the thinker list insertions in dthinker.cpp.

February 23, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: AWeaponPiece didn't declare its FullWeapon pointer as such.
- Fixed: Hexen's random player class skill menu was missing the '$' indicating 
  a string table identifier.
- Fixed: DCorpsePointer::Serialize didn't call the super method.

February 22, 2008
- Moved DSeqNode's and its children's destructor code into their Destroy()
  methods.
- Moved DSectorEffect's destructor code into a Destroy() method.
- Changed the myoffsetof definition to match DECLARE_POINTER's because GCC
  started complaining about its use in p_setup.cpp, though I'm not sure why.
- Added a pointer list to DACSThinker so that the collector can find scripts
  instead of thinking they're all dead.
- Added read barriers to sector_t's pointers.
- Used the HAS_OBJECT_POINTERS macros to locate places to place TObjPtrs to
  form read barriers.

February 21, 2008
- Fixed: DThinker::SerializeAll() did not serialize any thinkers in the
  FreshThinkers lists. These thinkers would still be saved in the savegame if
  there were other references to them, but they would not go in any thinker
  lists when loading the savegame. An easy way to exercise this bug is to
  give yourself something new with the console and then save the game right
  away without closing the console by using the "save" command. The item
  would be stored in the savegame thanks to its presence in the Inventory
  list, but it wouldn't be in a thinker list when the game was reloaded
  because it was still in the FreshThinkers list when the game was saved.
- Fixed: PO_Busy() did not check for a NULL return from GetPolyobj().
- Fixed two problems with printfs from the net controller stuff: one of them
  is totally valid, and the other is GCC not being as nice as VC++.
- Fixed: The case for defining SAVESIG when SVN_REVISION_NUMBER == 0 did not
  work for GCC (and presumably VC++, though I never ran into that case with
  it) because it tried to stringify something that wasn't a macro argument.

February 20, 2008
- Changed the DHUDMessage deletions into destroys.
- Added read barriers to the pointers inside AActor.
- Split the AActor::LastLook union into its constituent parts.

February 20, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a modified version of Karate Chris's submission for killing specific
  monsters with the 'Kill' ccmd.

February 19, 2008
- Added a rough initial garbage collector, based largely on Lua's. There are
  no write or read barriers in place yet, so it's not a very close
  approximation of the pointer cleaning code that was in place before, but it
  does collect stuff. But guess what! Nuts.wad ran at 1-2 FPS before. Now
  it's way, way more and easily stays above 35 FPS. The performance hit when
  the GC is running is pretty minimal compared to the old way, which was in
  many ways like a full garbage collection every tic.
- Changed the status bars into DObjects.
- Fixed: FBaseStatusBar::Tick() deleted hud messages instead of destroying
  them.
- Changed the global Args object to a pointer to one.
- Changed several DArgs deletions into destroys.
- Removed DBoundingBox from the DObject hierarchy.

February 18, 2008
- Added vid_refreshrate cvar to override Windows' automatic refresh rate
  selection.
- Singleplayers maps using allowrespawn now filter respawn inventory like
  coop games, since that's essentially what they are.
- Fixed m_alloc.cpp compilation on Linux.

February 18, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Applied Blzut3's sbarinfo update #12:
* When the drawbar code was optimized border was accidently used as how many
  pixels to reserve from the background instead of the foreground.  I've
  reversed how the code works (bg over fg instead of fg over bg).
* Added armorclass to drawnumber.
* Added an interpolateArmor variable which acts just like interpolateHealth
  except the effect is applied to armor.
* Added armor flag to drawgem since we can interpolate armor now.
* Added a reverse flag to drawgem.
* Fixed drawgem didn't allow for '|' to separate the flags.

- Fixed: Menu texts for skill definitions unconditionally interpreted
  the given text as an index into the string table.

February 16, 2008
- Fixed AInventory::PickupFlash setting with GCC.
- Fixed: The MusicVolumes list was allocated with M_Malloc but freed with
  delete.
- Fixed: demobuffer was inconsistantly handled with new[]/delete[] and
  malloc/free.
- Added used memory tracking to M_Malloc() and M_Realloc(). This
  necessitated the addition of an M_Free() call to track frees.
- Removed M_Calloc since it was only used in one place, and can just as well
  be done with an M_Malloc/memset pair.
- Bumped DEMOGAMEVERSION for the new net controller codes.

February 16, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added patch by Karate Chris:
  - The net arbitrator can add or remove players to an access list so they 
    can or cannot control game settings:
  * net_addcontroller <player number> - Adds a player to the control list.
    Only net arbitrators have access to this command.
  * net_removecontroller <player number> - Removes a player from the control
    list. Only net arbitrators have access to this command.
  * net_listcontrollers - Lists the players who are able to control the game
   settings.
  - Fixed: The 'Printf' occurrences in the 'addplayerclass' console command
    were all missing a '\n' at the end.
  - Enhanced the 'playerinfo' console command so more information about each
    setting is shown.
- Added customizable pickup flash.
- Added option to show shorter messages for save game and screenshot confirmation.
  Also added this to the 'Messages' menu.

February 14, 2008
- Version bump to 2.2.0.
- Disabled console alpha when the console is fullscreen.
- Re-enabled maybedrawnow for the software renderer. This should be replaced
  with a different progress bar implementation at some point that can work
  with hardware graphics.

February 14, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's patch for 0-tid == activator in action specials
  Thing_SetSpecial and Thing_SetTranslation.
- -moved BUG_FORUM_URL to version.h

February 13, 2008
- Removed most checks on vid_hw2d/test2d. This now gets checked only once per
  frame to avoid the remote possibility that it could change during the middle
  of drawing the frame and cause strange things to happen.
- Renamed test2d to vid_hw2d.

February 12, 2008
- Added the ACS script type "return". These are executed by players who return
  to a map they've previously been to. This is analagous to enter scripts, but
  whereas enter scripts execute only the first time a player enters a map,
  return scripts execute all but the first time.
- Improved map scrolling when rotation is on and follow mode is off.

February 11, 2008
- Fixed: Turning off follow mode with automap rotating enabled did not
  function in an easy-to-understand manner.
- Fixed: D_AddWildFile() blindly assumed that all matches were files.
- Added back the dead player check to CheckIfExitIsGood(), but now it
  applies only if the next map is part of the same hub. Otherwise, you can
  still exit the map while dead.
- Removed the SpawnedPuff global variable and made it a return value from 
  P_LineAttack().
- Fixed: P_SpawnPuff() played sounds for temporary puffs.

February 9, 2008
- Fixed: G_StartTravel() inadvertantly removed players' TIDs.
- Modified FLAC/share/alloc.h to define SIZE_T_MAX if it isn't defined
  already. For some reason, a stock install of MinGW doesn't define it, but
  if you compile your own GCC, it installs headers that do.
- After thoroughly messing up my MinGW/MSYS installation, I deleted the whole
  thing and reinstalled everything using the latest zips. Much to my surprise,
  the MSYS-detection in the makefiles no longer worked because OSTYPE wasn't
  being exported to process launched by the MSYS shell. I've now switched to a
  different method I found through the power of Google that asks the shell
  what version it is to see if the version string contains "msys".

February 8, 2008
- Applied Blzut3's sbarinfo update #11:
  * SBarInfo will also accept a '|' between flags for those who are really
    bothered by the indefinite "arguments" in the middle of the statement.
  * Added: completeBorder. When set to true SBarInfo will draw the border where
    the status bar normally goes.
  * Fixed: I forgot to accept TK_None on "base" and "statusbar".
  * Fixed: "base" was apparently broken when the SBarInfo init code was moved to
    d_main.cpp. Also, if "base Strife" was used then it would not use the
    default log message of "find help".
- Fixed: D_ReadUserInfoString() parsed the final element of a compact string
  as the empty string. Since that was the player class, this meant that any
  games with more than one class would pick a random class in multiplayer.
- Fixed: FCanvasTexture::RenderView() should not have color 0 in its output.

February 5, 2008
- Updated the GCC-targeted makefiles to turn off two optimizations that cause
  fmopl.cpp to compile incorrectly: tree-dominator-opts and tree-fre
- Fixed: Morphed pig and chicken players made normal human *usefail sounds.
- G_DoSaveGame() now receives the filename and description from its arguments
  rather than global variables, so autosaves and manual saves can be done
  in close proximity to each other without overwriting the parameters for
  one of them.
- Fixed potential buffer overrun in G_SaveGame() and added a check so that
  you can't interfere with saves that are still pending.
- Fixed: P_LineAttack() creates temporary puffs to get damage types, but this
  had the side effect of creating particles for the puff.
- Fixed: The Heretic status bar tried to use the graphic "SELECTBOX" for the
  inventory selector. The correct name is "SELECTBO".
- Fixed: Using allowrespawn for a single-player map would fire off enter
  scripts instead of respawn script because the player wasn't assigned the
  state PST_REBORN.
- Fixed: P_CheckMissileSpawn() now passes the BlockingMobj to
  P_ExplodeMissile() so that it can select the appropriate death state.
- Added the manifest to MinGW-compiled builds of updaterevision so you can
  build under Vista with MinGW without needing administrative privileges.
  (But I still want to know why Vista thinks it needs elevated privileges
  without a manifest telling it otherwise.)
- Using four 0xFF bytes for the final note of an IMF song should signal the
  end of the song.

February 4, 2008
- Applied a modified version of Karate Chris's screenshot naming patch.
- Sbarinfo optimization: Creating and destroying bar textures every frame is
  a relatively expensive operation. We can skip the custom texture entirely
  and just draw the bars directly to the screen, using the clipping parameters
  for DrawTexture(). This also means bars are no longer limited to the game
  palette, and the bar itself has the same resolution as the screen.

February 2, 2008
- Removed support for numeric flags from sbarinfo's drawmugshot command since
  it was previously declared unrecommended and deprecated.
- Added Blzut3's sbarinfo update #10:
  * Fixed: drawmugshot now adjust to the player's max health like it should.
  * drawgem can now accept negative paddings.
  * Added: You can now specify a border on drawbar which will reserve x
    amount of pixels on each side of the fg image.
  * Added: weaponammo command which allows for determining what kind of ammo
    the current weapon uses.
  * Added: Drawkeybar to SBarInfo

January 31, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The STYLEF_Alpha1 flag intended for STYLE_Normal was set for STYLE_Fuzzy.
- Fixed: The render style table for old decorations was missing STYLE_Stencil so
  STYLE_Translucent was mapped incorrectly.

January 30, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added support for AttackZOffset to P_RailAttack.
- Fixed: ParseDrawTextureTags read DTA_RenderStyle as ERenderStyle, not FRenderStyle.

January 29, 2008
- Added pixel-doubled and -quadrupled screen modes to D3DFB so that users with
  recent NVidia drivers can still use resolutions below 640x480, since NVidia
  saw fit to remove all support for them.

January 27, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a PrecacheTexture virtual function to DFrameBuffer because it's the
  renderer which should decide how to precache a texture.
- Added SnowKate709's APROP_MaxHealth submission.
- Fixed: FTexture::GetScaledWidth/Height always rounded down which could result in
  imprecisions (e.g. when scaling from 128 to 96.)
- added a mastervolume CVAR for Timidity because for me its output is considerably 
  louder than everything else.
- reverted removal of AddPatch call in crosshair initialization.
- Modified makewad.c so that it doesn't write file names with '[]^' to the 
  dependency file. Apparenly make can't handle these names and an incomplete
  list is still better than something that doesn't work at all.
- Changed license for r_data.cpp because there isn't anything of id's original
  code left in that file.
- Cleaned up r_data.cpp.
- Fixed: FTextureManager::FindTexture should not print error messages if it
  doesn't find the texture.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for fixing Strife quit messages.

January 26, 2008
- Added preloading of fonts to reduce the chance that characters from a single
  font will require more than one hardware texture to display.
- Fixed: P_RailAttack() crashed if you didn't specify a puff for a rail.
- Decided that allowing arbitrary alpha values for color remaps isn't so hot.
  Changed it back the way it was.

January 26, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Got rid of most TexMan.AddPatch calls because they are no longer needed.
- Got rid of R_InitPatches because the new texture init code needs to preload
  everything to work correctly.
- Rewrote texture manager initialization to order textures primarily by WAD 
  rather than by type. This way later textures will always override earlier 
  ones. The only exception is that TEX_MiscPatch are only used as a fallback
  if nothing else can be found.
- Optimized the tryany case of FTextureManager::CheckForTexture. It is not
  necessary to scan the hash chain twice. The required information can be
  retrieved during the first pass as easily and even offers a little more
  control.
- Made FFont destructor virtual.
- Added 'Ice' translation to DECORATE.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for teamplay MAPINFO option.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for custom damage color per player class.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for respawnlimit skill property.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for Strife quit messages.
- Fixed: P_RailAttack ignored the puff's damage type.
- Fixed: ACS used incompatible values for APROP_RenderStyle. It needs to use
  the exact same values as previous ZDoom versions
- Added a DECORATE 'stencilcolor' property so that the stencil render style
  can be used.
- Added some NULL pointer checks to the font loading code.

January 25, 2008
- Undid some of the changes from lempar.c v1.30->v1.31, because it broke
  error handling.
- Fixed: dehsupp/scanner.re defined "}" as the token RPAREN. dehsupp/parse.y
  also defined action_list_def as needing a RBARCE. I'm surprised it worked
  at all before. I guess Lemon really was too accepting. I have verified that
  the lump it outputs is unchanged from before.
- Changed the way that xlatcc handles include statements so that I don't need
  to modify the logic of lempar.c. I also discovered that the grammar was
  improperly defined and only accepted the first statement. It worked before
  because Lemon used to accept multiple times before reaching the EOF token.
  I have also verified that it is still generating the proper lumps.
- Removed some unused wadsrc files from the repository.
- Fixed my re2c upgrade.
- Back to lemon.c v1.53 now. The bad change was v1.51: "Changes lemon so
  that the generated parser does not accept prior to seeing the EOF token."
  This seems like a valid change, which means I need to rethink my strategy
  for handling include statements, since this change breaks what I was
  doing before.
- Lemon is now producing parsers that don't accept anything, so I'm going
  back to v1.43 and trying each intermediate version to see where things
  went wrong.

January 24, 2008
- Updated Lemon to its latest versions as of today.
  (lemon.c: v1.53, lempar.c: v1.31)
- Added .txt files to the list of types (wad, zip, and pk3) that can be
  loaded without listing them after -file.
- Fonts that are created by the ACS setfont command to wrap a texture now
  support animated textures.
- FON2 fonts can now use their full palette for CR_UNTRANSLATED when drawn
  with the hardware 2D path instead of being restricted to the game palette.

January 23, 2008
- Fixed: Toggling vid_vsync would reset the displayed fullscreen gamma to 1
  on a Radeon 9000.
- Added back the off-by-one palette handling, but in a much more limited
  scope than before. The skipped entry is assumed to always be at 248, and
  it is assumed that all Shader Model 1.4 cards suffer from this. That's
  because all SM1.4 cards are based on variants of the ATI R200 core, and the
  RV250 in a Radeon 9000 craps up like this. I see no reason to assume that
  other flavors of the R200 are any different. (Interesting note: With the
  Radeon 9000, D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP is an invalid address mode when using the
  debug Direct3D 9 runtime, but it works perfectly fine with the retail
  Direct3D 9 runtime.) (Insight: The R200 probably uses bytes for all its
  math inside pixel shaders. That would explain perfectly why I can't use
  constants greater than 1 with PS1.4 and why it can't do an exact mapping to
  every entry in the color palette.
- Fixed: The software shaded drawer did not work for 2D, because its selected
  "color"map was replaced with the identitymap before being used.
- Fixed: I cannot use Printf to output messages before the framebuffer was
  completely setup, meaning that Shader Model 1.4 cards could not change
  resolution.
- I have decided to let remap palettes specify variable alpha values for
  their colors. D3DFB no longer forces them to 255.

January 22, 2008
- Updated re2c to version 0.12.3.
- Fixed: A_Wander used threshold as a timer, when it should have used
  reactiontime.
- Fixed: A_CustomRailgun would not fire at all for actors without a target
  when the aim parameter was disabled.
- Made the warp command work in multiplayer, again courtesy of Karate Chris.
- Fixed: Trying to spawn a bot while not in a game made for a crashing time.
  (Patch courtesy of Karate Chris.)

January 21, 2008
- Removed some floating point math from hu_scores.cpp that somebody's GCC
  gave warnings for (not mine, though).
- Fixed: The SBarInfo drawbar command crashed if the sprite image was
  unavailable.
- Fixed: FString::operator=(const char *) did not release its old buffer when
  being assigned to the null string.
- The scanner no longer has an upper limit on the length of strings it
  accepts, though short strings will be faster than long ones.
- Moved all the text scanning functions into a class. Mainly, this means that
  multiple script scanner states can be stored without being forced to do so
  recursively. I think I might be taking advantage of that in the near
  future. Possibly. Maybe.
- Removed some potential buffer overflows from the decal parser.

January 18, 2008
- Applied Blzut3's SBARINFO update #9:
  * Fixed: When using even length values in drawnumber it would cap to a 98
    value instead of a 99 as intended.
  * The SBarInfo parser can now accept negatives for coordinates. This
    doesn't allow much right now, but later I plan to add better fullscreen
    hud support in which the negatives will be more useful. This also cleans
    up the source a bit since all calls for (x, y) coordinates are with the
    function getCoordinates().
- Added support for stencilling actors.
- Added support for non-black colors specified with DTA_ColorOverlay to the
  software renderer.
- Fixed: The inverse, gold, red, and green fixed colormaps each allocated
  space for 32 different colormaps, even though each only used the first one.
- Added two new blending flags to make reverse subtract blending more useful:
  STYLEF_InvertSource and STYLEF_InvertOverlay. These invert the color that
  gets blended with the background, since that seems like a good idea for
  reverse subtraction. They also work with the other two blending operations.

January 17, 2008
- Added subtract and reverse subtract blending operations to the renderer.
  Since the ERenderStyle enumeration was getting rather unwieldy, I converted
  it into a new FRenderStyle structure that lets each parameter of the
  blending equation be set separately. This simplified the set up for the
  blend quite a bit, and it means a number of new combinations are available
  by setting the parameters properly.

January 16, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The StatusBar pointer was not NULLed after being deleted.

January 15, 2008
- Plugged more leaks in SBARINFO.
- Spawned actors that have MF2_DORMANT set in their default instance now have
  Deactivate() called on them immediately after spawning.

January 15, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Skip_Super didn't clear the current state label list.

January 14, 2008
- Fixed: ACS translations were loaded into the wrong slot after restoring a
  savegame.
- Fixed exploit: Dropping ammo at baby and nightmare skill levels would give
  you back more than you dropped.

January 13, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved A_Punch from Inventory to Actor. Apparently there are WADs that use it
  for monsters. The function works fine for monsters as it is.

January 12, 2008
- Applied Blzut3's SBARINFO update #8:
  * Fixed: Drawbar had a few memory leaks.
- Applied Blzut3's SBARINFO update #7:
  * Added drawstring to SBARINFO.
  * Added animatedgodmode flag to drawmugshot, also changed the flags to use the
    standard named arguments instead of numbers.  The old way is considered
    deprecated.
  * Added kills, monsters, items, totalitems, secrets, and totalsecrets to
    drawnumber.  Drawbar can also use kills, items, and secrets.
  * Added weaponicon to drawimage which will display the inventory.icon of the
    currently selected weapon.
  * Fixed: I apparently forgot to add the "rampage" face to drawmugshot.

January 12, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved renderer dependent part of savegame pic creation into DFrameBuffer
  as a virtual function so that it can be overridden.
- Fixed: M_SaveBitmap::prior was too small. It must be 3 bytes per pixel,
  not 1.
- Replaced INVGEM** graphics with PNG versions so that they have the
  correct colors when used on the AltHUD in Strife.

January 11, 2008
- Added support for 24-bit screenshots, so now accelerated 2D screenshots
  can work.
- Tweaked the box splitting algorithm for packed textures to hopefully
  produce less wasted space.
- For compatibility with the software renderer, D3DFB::DrawTextureV needs to
  truncate the coordinates to integers before sending them to the hardware.
  Otherwise, there can be one pixel gaps compared to the software renderer,
  because the hardware is rounding to nearest but the software renderer is
  simply truncating the fractional part of the coordinate. This is the real
  cause of the gap above the status bar at 1152x864 (and another gap to the
  left of the status bar at 800x500).
- Fixed: When D3DFB::DrawTextureV had to clip a tile, it adjusted the 
  texture coordinates erroneously, still using the old calculations from
  before texture packing was implemented.
- Moved thingdef_codeptr.cpp into thingdef/ with the other thingdef files.

January 11, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Skulltag's pickup sprite and related information to the pistol. This
  will also double as the pistol's icon in the AltHUD.
- Added a generic log display that can show Strife's log messages in all games
  regardless of the current game, active status bar and HUD mode.
- Added GZDoom's alt HUD.

January 10, 2008
- Fixed: After loading a savegame, G_UnSnapshotLevel() destroyed the
  unmorphed versions of players because it thought they were extras.
- Fixed: Weapon positions were only adjusted in 1280x1024 if the status
  bar was hidden.
- Fixed: If you died in co-op and somebody else ended the map before you
  respawned, you would start the next map with only default inventory, no
  matter what dmflags was set to.
- Applied Karate Chris's TEAMINFO logo patch.

January 10, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved the code that renders the view from D_Display into a virtual function
  of the frame buffer so I can get rid of the last remaining renderer check
  outside the display code in GZDoom.
- made V_SetResolution a virtual function in IVideo. It's probably not a perfect
  solution but at least it allows overriding it (which I need in GZDoom.)
  Note: There's a lot of redundancy between hardware.cpp/h in the SDL and Win32
  folders so some cleaning up might be a good idea.
- defined a constant for the crosshair menu entry's index to get a direct
  reference out of the function code. In GZDoom the menu contains different
  information.
- Fixed: The BrainExplosions should not perform any collision detection. To
  achieve this their Damage value must be set to 0 when being spawned.

January 9, 2008
- Added Blzut3's SBARINFO update #6:
  * Fixed: A tutti-frutti like effect would occur if transparent images were
    used in bars.
  * Fixed: drawswitchableimage didn't count having 0 of an item as not having
    the said item.
  * Added alwaysshowcounter flag to both drawinventorybar and
    drawselectedinventory.
  * Added armoricon image type to drawimage.
  * Added low-on secondary coloring and high-on coloring to drawnumber.
- Added texture packing to D3DFB so that textures that are temporally related
  can share the same hardware texture. This greatly reduces the number of
  DrawPrimitive calls that need to be made when drawing text (or any 2D
  graphics in general), so now hardware text is much faster than software text
  all around. (As an example, one scenario went from 315 fps to over 1635 fps
  for hardware, compared to 540 fps for software.)
- Fixed: The mouse was being grabbed in windowed mode again.
- Modified M_DrawFrame() and R_DrawTopBorder() so that they call FlatFill() to
  draw the edges of the frames. This at least seems a bit faster for hardware
  2D.
- Implemented FlatFill() for D3DFB. It seems to be exactly as fast as the
  default implementation that just calls DrawTexture() to tile the pieces onto
  the screen, so I'm not sure it was worth the bother.
- Merged the separate line and quad vertex buffers in D3DFB back into a single
  vertex buffer, made line batching automatic, and added an index buffer for
  use when batching quads. The index buffer actually offered more of a
  performance boost than simply batching the quads alone did.

January 9, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a safety check to savegame versioning so that an invalid revision
  (reported as 0) will be handled without breaking savegame compatibility.
- Fixed: 'Painchance' in DECORATE failed when reading custom damage type names.
- Added Karate Chris's patch for menu opening console commands.

January 8, 2008
- Fixed: When starting a teamplay netgame, players who did not specify a team
  were not informed about which team they ended up joining.
- Added Skulltag's DF2_SAME_SPAWN_SPOT flags.
- Fixed: DF2_YES_DEGENERATION was pretty much guaranteed to go out of sync
  because it used gametic for timing.
- Added DoubleAmmoFactor as a skill property for the DF2_YES_DOUBLEAMMO flag.
- Renumbered the dmflags2 entries to match Skulltag's again.
- Added Karate Chris's infinite inventory patch.

January 7, 2008
- Added support for user-defined crosshairs in the Display Options menu. See
  xhairs.txt in zdoom.pk3. It's pretty simple.
- Fixed: P_BounceWall() cannot assume that BlockingLine is the line the actor
  should bounce off of. Since the order lines in a blockmap cell are checked
  for collision is essentially undefined, there could be another line closer to
  the actor that it should bounce off of instead.
- Fixed: Thing_SetTranslation still used a 16-bit word to hold the translation.
- Bumped the maximum resolution up to 2560x1600.
- Fixed: DCanvas::DrawTexture() only expanded virtual screen sizes for widescreen
  resolutions but left 5:4 modes alone. This fix neccessitated the addition of
  DTA_Bottom320x200 for the status bar to use so that it could be flush with the
  bottom of the screen rather than sitting slightly above it.
- Fixed: FConfigFile::ReadConfig()'s definition of whitespace was too broad.
- Fixed: Defining custom translation ranges in descending order and/or with gaps
  made for crashes.

January 7, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added fix for Heretic IDKFA cheat by Karate Chris.
- Added fix for Strife's AlienSpectre obituary by Karate Chris.

January 6, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Re-converted icebreak.flac because the old version apparently didn't work.
- Added SBARINFO update #5 by blzut3:
    - Fixed: Playerclass still didn't work due to comparing of improper numbers.
    - Fixed: The arrows on drawinventorybar had a hard coded location instead of
      relative to the specified coordinates.
    - Added noarrows flag to drawinventorybar to remove the blue arrows drawn when
      there are more items to the left or right of the viewable bar.
    - Added forcescaled flag to the statusbar command.  This is ignored on the
      inventory and inventoryfullscreen types.
- Added obituary fix for Strife peasants by Karate Chris.
- Added fix for loading during demo playback by Karate Chris.
- Added scoreboard fix by Karate Chris.
- Added teamgame fix for menu by Karate Chris.
- Added GZDoom's Sector_Outside sector type which forces outside fog
  regardless of ceiling texture.

January 6, 2008
- Fixed: Since the minimum size for a texture is 2x2, FBarShader can't use
  a one-dimensional texture.
- Added back the code to allow some variation to the players' shades when
  players are on teams.
- Set TEAM_None back to 255. Since a player's team has already been accessible
  through ACS, needlessly redefining this is a bad thing to do, since it can
  break existing maps. 255 different teams should still be more than enough.
- Fixed: At certain resolutions, there was a one pixel row between the status
  bar and the rest of the screen, thanks to rounding error.
- Added automatic batching of quads to D3DFB. Screens with a lot of text are
  ever-so-slightly faster now, though still only about half the speed of
  sofware-only text. I suppose the only way to see a marked improvement is
  going to be by stuffing multiple glyphs in a single texture.
- Fixed: Crosshairgrow's animation was not framerate-independent.

January 5, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added: Automap markers are stored in savegames now. Also moved the call
  to AM_LevelInit to its proper place in G_DoLoadLevel, right after
  the call to P_SetupLevel to make it work as intended.
- Changed savegame versioning to use the SVN revision number instead of
  an arbitrarily defined value. This reduces the amount of relevant values
  that have to be defined in version.h to 1 (the minimum compatible savegame
  version) instead of previously 3.

January 4, 2008
- Fixed: FBarShader::PrepareShader() set a member variable to point at a
  local variable just before returning. Then I made some more changes so that
  it can be a properly functioning texture. After doing that, I decided to
  rewrite the texture generation to be easier for me to read and hopefully
  faster, since this thing is getting generated every frame. (Please don't
  hurt me if I got it wrong. I'm basing this on the description in the wiki,
  since I couldn't wrap my head around what the code was doing by looking
  at it.) Then I realized that there's really no reason to have more than four
  of these ever, and they can be statically generated, so I simplified it some
  more.
- Added Blzut3's latest SBARINFO patch:
 * Fixed a massive memory leak in SBARINFO. The leak also lead to progressive
   CPU usage.
 * Fixed: Playerclass didn't work in SBARINFO.
 * Fixed: Artiflash was improperly initialized causing it not to display the
   first time.
 * Changed the variable SBarInfoScript to be a pointer to prevent more memory
   leaks.

January 4, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed the patches for the Doom/Heretic E1 intermission screens from 
  R_InitPatches. This isn't needed anymore because all these are loaded through
  an intermission script.
- Fixed: A_SpawnDebris read the third and fourth arguments from the first one's
  address.

January 3, 2008
- Moved the pixel shaders' color information out of the constant registers
  and into the vertex data.
- Added functions for doing line drawing with Direct3D, including a new pair
  of functions to do batched line drawing so that the map can actually be
  drawn faster in hardware than in software (instead of an order of magnitude
  slower).

January 2, 2008
- Tried adding bilinear filtering support for paletted textures, but the
  shader seems to be producing crappy output, so it's disabled for now.
  Specifically, it produces distorted output at regular intervals for
  textures that aren't power-of-2-sized, and it's still doing visible
  filtering when the texture is rendered at its original size, so
  obviously it's not doing something right.
- Fixed the use of power-of-2-sized native textures for smaller game
  textures again.
- Fixed: D3DFB did not restore all the state it needed to after resetting
  the device.
- Fixed: R_DrawTopBorder() must clip itself around the 3D view, since it's
  now drawn later.
- With full software rendering, palette flashes once again affect the whole
  screen.

January 1, 2008
- The mouse is no longer grabbed at all unless you're actually in a level,
  since I couldn't think of any reason why it should be grabbed at any other
  time. (This only applies to windowed mode, where it makes sense to let the
  OS have control of the pointer.)
- Moved the view border drawing into the 2D mode part. When using Begin2D()
  now, the only part of the software buffer that gets updated to the screen
  is the part with the actual 3D scene and only if you tell it to.
- Fixed a D3D memory leak on every frame in windowed mode and the same thing
  for the screen wipes. Note to self: If it's an interface, be sure to
  Release it, because it will be AddRef'ed before being returned to you.
- Moved the BlendView() call out of DBaseStatusBar::Draw() so that it can be
  applied before copying the 3D scene to the screen underneath the 2D parts.
- Restored the console's darkening level to its old table-based amount.
- Fixed D3DFB::SetColorOverlay()'s incorrect calculations.
- Fixed the D3D screen wipes for letterboxed modes.

January 1, 2008 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: A_JumpIfTargetInLOS had inconsistent parameter definitions.

December 31, 2007
- Removed the screenshot parameter from D_Display(), since it was a relic of
  a long-abandoned experiment to write directly to video memory instead of
  to a temporary buffer in system memory.
- Added Direct3D versions of the melt and burn screenwipes.
- Fixed the strip sizes for the melt screenwipe to match what Doom would have
  produced on a 320x200 screen, rather than producing more, thinner strips
  for wider screens.

December 29, 2007
- Started writing Direct3D-friendly wipe code. It's just a Q&D crossfade for
  now.

December 29, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed the FStatusBarTexture for Doom so that it can create a true color 
  image.

December 28, 2007
- Fixed position of the Doom HUD selectbox as per SnowKate709's guidance.

December 28, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed FImageCollection so that it accepts a matching texture of any type.
  This is necessary to load hires sprite replacements for certain icons.
- Added a check to Wads.CheckNumForName to return -1 for names longer than
  8 characters which contain path separators.
- Fixed: Hires texture replacement must replace all matching textures, not
  just the first one found. This is particularly important for icons based
  on sprites.
- added a con_alpha CVAR to set the console's translucency.
- Added MartinHowe's submission for A_CustomBulletAttack aimfacing parameter.
- Added MartinHowe's submission for A_PlaySoundEx attenuation parameter.
- Fixed: Bots shouldn't target friendly monsters.
- Fixed a typo in sbarinfo.cpp (noatribox instead of noartibox.)

December 27, 2007
- Fixed cases where a larger power-of-2-sized native texture had to be
  allocated. (I wonder if D3D actually handles this automatically when you use
  D3DPOOL_MANAGED, because I'm pretty sure my laptops's x300 doesn't support
  non-power-of-2 texture sizes, yet it worked just fine before.) 
- Fixed vertical positioning of 2D elements in letterboxed modes.
- Removed DCanvas::Blit(), as it's no longer used.
- Added a function to create a texture from a stand-alone PNG file. The save/
  load menus now use this to get their thumbnails.

December 27, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: DFrameBuffer::CopyPixelData copied data as RGBA instead of BGRA.
- Temporarily changed FPNGTexture and FDDSTexture to always create True Color
  native textures to preserve the original colors.
- Darkened the console background a little after finding out that on
  very bright title pics it became quite hard to read the console's contents.
- Fixed: PROP_Translation needed to be changed for the new value format.
- Added GZDoom's MAPINFO fog parameters as no op dummies so I can use
  WADs that contain them without constantly having to edit the MAPINFO.
  It also allows using them to optimize hardware fog for WADs that should
  run with ZDoom as well.

December 26, 2007
- Changed the way gamma works for D3DFB: In windowed mode, the display is
  drawn to a texture, then that texture is copied to the real back buffer
  using a gamma-correcting pixel shader. In fullscreen mode, SetGammaRamp
  is used.
- Fixed flashing of vid_fps display when fps > 1000.
- Fixed loading of RGB textures for native 2D mode.
- Changed the first rotozoomer's data because it just became too obvious when
  the backdrop is drawn with a full 256 distinct colors available.
- Set the player backdrop to update no more frequently than 35 FPS, so opening
  the player setup menu before starting a game won't produce a very fast
  moving backdrop.
- Changed the player backdrop into a texture so that it can be drawn like
  anything else.
- Enhanced TMap so that you can get at the iterator types by accessing them
  like class members.

December 26, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The FSpecialFont constructor copied the untranslated colors directly
  from the source palette instead of the font's identity map.
- Split off the entire translation code from r_draw.cpp into r_translate.cpp.
- Moved the common code of ACS and DECORATE translation generation into the
  FRemapTable class.
- Fixed: The DECORATE translation code was not changed for the new data structures.
- Expanded range of ACS and DECORATE translations to 65535. 
- Fixed: R_CopyTranslation was not altered for the new functionality.
  I removed the function and replaced the one use with a simple assignment.

December 25, 2007
- Fixed: The fullscreen console crashed when opened before starting a game.
- Discovered that Shader Model 1.4 clamps my constants, so I can't use
  palettes smaller than 256 entries with the shader I wrote for it. Is there
  a list of gotchas like this listed some where? I'd really like to see it.
  
  Well, when compiled with SM2.0, the PalTex shader seems to be every-so-
  slightly faster on my GF7950GT than the SM1.4 version, so I guess it's a
  minor win for cards that support it.

December 25, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Replaced 'C:\\ZDOOMDAT' with a #define in version.h.
- Moved screenshot code into DCanvas so that it can be overridden by
  subclasses with a different buffer.
- added a P_PointInSector function and replaced all calls to retrieve an
  actor's sector in the game engine code with it. This way there's a clear
  distinction between renderer-specific and game-specific calls.
- added UseInventory/UseActorInventory ACS functions.

December 24, 2007
- Fixed: ST_Endoom() failed to free the bitmap it used.
- Added the DTA_ColorOverlay attribute to blend a color with the texture
  being drawn. For software, this (currently) only works with black. For
  hardware, it works with any color. The motiviation for this was so I could
  rewrite the status bar calls that passed DIM_MAP to DTA_Translation to
  draw darker icons into something that didn't require making a whole new
  remap table.
- After having an "OMG! How could I have been so stupid?" moment, I have
  removed the off-by-one check from D3DFB. I had thought the off-by-one error
  was caused by rounding errors by the shader hardware. Not so. Rather, I
  wasn't sampling what I thought I was sampling. A texture that uses palette
  index 255 passes the value 1.0 to the shader. The shader needs to adjust the
  range of its palette indexes, or it will end up trying to read color 256
  from the palette texture when it should be reading color 255. Doh!
- The TranslationToTable() function has been added to map from translation
  numbers used by actors to the tables those numbers represent. This function
  performs validation for the input and returns NULL if the input value
  is invalid.
- Major changes to the way translation tables work: No longer are they each a
  256-byte array. Instead, the FRemapTable structure is used to represent each
  one. It includes a remap array for the software renderer, a palette array
  for a hardware renderer, and a native texture pointer for D3DFB. The
  translationtables array itself is now an array of TArrays that point to the
  real tables. The DTA_Translation attribute must also be passed a pointer
  to a FRemapTable, not a byte array as previously.

December 24, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added some functionality to FDynamicColormap to allow not creating
  the colormap data.
- also replaced the AM crosshair drawer by a DCanvas::DrawPixel function.
- moved the AM line drawer into DCanvas as a virtual function. While testing
  this code I discovered that the antialias precalculation was never used
  except for the very first frame of AM drawing. However, since I couldn't
  detect even a marginal performance improvement using this code on 2 computers
  I just disabled it completely because it severely complicates a more generic
  implementation. I also disabled am_ovtrans in the process because I couldn't
  see any positive effects of using this cvar. All it does is adding some 
  ugly distortion to the lines it affects without any apparent benefits.
* Added fix by Karate Chris containing:
- Added a 'No team changing' DMFlag2 which prevents players from changing teams 
  unless they are not on a team.
- Added a 'No respawn' DMFlag2 which prevents a player from respawning after 
  they have died.
- Added a 'Keep frags gained' DMFlag2 which allows you to choose whether you 
  want to reset the frags of each player next level or not.
- Added a small visual enhancement to the cooperative scoreboard to show 
  if a player has died.
- Fixed: If the 'teamplay' console variable was set to 'true' in a cooperative 
  game, the scoreboard would show team play related items as opposed to 
  cooperative items.
- Fixed: The 'bot_observer' console variable should not work in network games.
- Fixed: Bots made intermission skip really fast.
  
December 23, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed a few font related problems.
- Fixed: ASkyViewpoint::Destroy was missing the super call.
- Added SnowKate709's A_LookEx update.
- Moved M_DrawPlayerBackdrop into DCanvas as a virtual function. Since this
  directly accesses the frame buffer it must be overridable for rendereres
  that work differently.
- Added Blzut3's third SBARINFO update:
 * Added drawshader to draw Heretic style transparency gradients.
 * Added artiflash flag to drawselectedinventory.
 * Fixed: Drawgem used the wrong operator when determining the chain size.
 * Fixed: ZDoom would crash if an undefined font was used.
 * I also started cleaning up the source a little.  I have been informed that
 when checking for flags the "== flagname" is redundant.
- Added indexfont anf hudfont from GZDoom to zdoom.pk3 so that they are always 
  available when defining custom status bars.
- Added Karate Chris's 'sv_losefrag' submission.
- Added Karate Chris's 'sv_degeneration' submission.
- Fixed: 'Bot joined the team' message was passing an FString to Printf.
- Backported GZDoom's true color font mappings for use with native textures
  when the time comes.
- Added Karate Chris's 'sv_doubleammo' submission.
- Added Karate Chris's 'Take' console command submission.
- Changed DTA_Translation parameter for DrawTexture to an integer to avoid
  passing renderer specific data to the function. Also added DTA_Font so
  that the renderer can fetch font translations from the proper font.
  DIM_MAP/ConShade had to be made a regular translation table to make it
  work.
- Added Karate Chris's fix for scoreboard displaying team play related data
  in non teamplay games.
- Fixed: The team selection menu didn't work.
- Fixed: UpdateTeam passed an FString to Printf.

December 22, 2007
- Modified DFrameBuffer::DrawRateStuff() so that it can do its thing properly
  for D3DFB's 2D mode. Before, any fullscreen graphics (like help images)
  covered it up.
- Had a look at sbarinfo.cpp and noticed a few places where it allocated
  character arrays and never freed them. Those have been replaced with
  uses of FString. (One of these was even an instance of a member variable
  being set to point at a stack variable.)

December 22, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's teamdamage in MAPINFO submission.
- Added Blzut3's second SBARINFO update.
- Fixed: The second flash state of the chaingun called A_Light1 instead of A_Light2.
- Added Blzut3's SBARINFO update.

December 21, 2007
- Added versions of Dim and Clear to D3DFB for use in 2D mode.
- Added a new color parameter to DCanvas::Clear() that specifies the
  ARGB value of the color. This is used if the old color parameter,
  which specifies a palette entry, is -1.
- Fixed: TEAMINFO broke bot parsing for bots with invalid team names by
  redefining TEAM_None from 255 to -1.

December 21, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's fix for TEAMINFO definitions with just one team.

December 20, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Blzut3's SBARINFO submission.
- Added SnowKate709's A_LookEx submission.
- Added Karate Chris's TEAMINFO submission.
- Added true color processing to FDDSTexture. This is untested so far 
  because I don't have any DDS textures to check it with.
- Fixed: FTexture::~FTexture() must destroy the associated native texture
  if present.
- Modified GZDoom's true color texture copy functions and added them
  to generate 32 bit D3D textures. Paletted TGAs and PCXs are also handled
  this way but I don't think these 2 formats are worth some more special
  handling.
  (Question: Is it worth it to implement special handling for paletted PNGs
   so that they are used as 8 bit textures internally?)
- Fixed: DCanvas::Blit unlocked the destination twice instead of unlocking 
  both dest and src. Also changed this function so that it is owned by the
  destination canvas of the operation which is necessary if it needs to 
  be overridden by subclasses.
- Fixed: The StrifePlayer defined the wrong color range for its translations.

December 19, 2007
- Added a framework for drawing the 2D screen elements with Direct3D textures.
  They are not actually drawn with it yet, nor is it complete, but it's
  something to start with. While doing this, I noticed the DTA_Shadow stuff
  doesn't do anything. I'll probably remove them rather than fix them, since
  it's easier to draw the shadow with a separate DrawTexture call.
- Split up DCanvas::DrawTexture() into more pieces to make it easier to
  virtualize.
- Removed support for non-32-bit palette textures from D3DFB. What kind of
  card supports pixel shaders but not 32-bit textures?

December 17, 2007
- Fixed: In the video modes menu, pressing Enter tried to change the screen
  mode, even if the cursor wasn't on one of the mode items.
- Fixed: Heretic's mace never respawned in deathmatch games.
- Fixed: At resolutions taller than 600 pixels or so, tall sky textures were
  drawn a row too low. This was quite visible on Hexen MAP06.
- Fixed: P_CheckSlopeWalk() must return false if floorsector != sector, or
  the actor will be yanked down to the floorsector by P_TryMove().
- Fixed: ClearActorInventory, GiveActorInventory, and TakeActorInventory
  only affected the first actor with the given TID.
- Fixed: The color boxes for the colorpicker menu items were drawn a little
  too low.
- Fixed: Clean scaling at 720x480 looked borked.
- New: When using the D3D9 framebuffer, palette blending is now applied only
  to the 3D area of the screen. This means the console and (the primary
  rectangular area of) the status bar are no longer blended. Maybe somedays
  when I'm feeling adventurous, I'll exclude all the 2D graphics from the
  blending.

December 17, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: When a skybox viewpoint is destroyed it should clear all
  sector references to itself.

December 14, 2007
- Fixed: G_QueueBody() should only change the translation to one of its
  private slots if the one currently used is a player range.
- Fixed: Changing the fraglimit during the middle of a game would not trigger
  a level change if somebody was already over the new limit.
- Added "\c" support to ParseCommandLine() when it parses quoted strings.
- Fixed: When changing your name from the menu, you got an extra " appended
  to your name if it ended with a backslash.
- Added escape sequences for user info strings, so now they can contain
  embedded backslashes.
- Fixed an array-out-of-bounds access when drawing the player setup menu with
  an invalid team number.

December 10, 2007
- Fixed: The MAPINFO flags that control jumping, crouching, and freelook,
  rather than overriding the dmflags values, actually overwrote the dmflags
  values, so they would continue to be in effect on later maps that didn't
  explicitly specify them.
- Fixed: Redefining a decal did not rebind any old references to the decal, so
  they would be left pointing at invalid data.
- Fixed some more GCC warnings.
- Updated project files for nasm 2.0, which is now named nasm.exe for the
  Windows version, rather than nasmw.exe. Also fixed the annoying new warnings
  it generated.

December 10, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: M_VerifyNightmare must use the selected skill level to start the
  game, not always 4.

December 9, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: There was no working means to pass 'no state' to A_Chase.
  Now 0 or an empty string will do that.
- Copied the empty string fix for SC_CheckNumber to SC_CheckFloat.

December 8, 2007
- Fixed: SECSPAC_EyesSurface and SECSPAC_EyesDive did not trigger due to
  crouching motion.
- Fixed: The keypress for nightmare mode verification appeared in the console
  if the fullscreen console was open while using the menu.
- Added support for scaling down large console fonts in the customize
  controls menu.
- Fixed: Joining a negative team was possible.
- Fixed: Skill level confirmation only worked with Doom. Also fixed parsing
  of MustConfirm: It looked for TK_String when it should have used TK_StringConst.
- Fixed: When travelling to a new non-hub map, any items being carried with
  amounts of 0 would be upped to 1.
- Fixed: When the game starts with the net pane open, the abort button
  receives the input focus. When the pane is closed, the focus doesn't
  return to any window, so even though the window is still active, it no
  longer has the focus and does not receive input events.
- Fixed: The network synch timer was still left running after the game
  started. (Windows only)
- Fixed: When a player leaves the game at the exact moment they are being
  damaged, the game could crash because their actor still had a valid player
  pointer, but the player's mo pointer had been NULLed.
- Fixed: MAPINFO is parsed before the text colors are read, so the TextColor
  option for skills wouldn't work.
- Changed the PowerTimeFreezer "blink" effect back to checking against
  EffectTics (now + 1), because I wasn't convinced of the correctness of
  using level.time.
- Fixed: SC_CheckNumber() considered the empty string "" as the number 0.
- Reverted the 'None' name change from r569.

December 6, 2007
- Fixed the PowerTimeFreezer, too. It got easier once I realized that I only
  need to be concerned about changing the flag on odd tics, since A_Tracer()
  is called every two tics, not four.
- Fixed: Using the freeze command would make the Revenant missiles switch
  their seekingness. The only sane way to deal with this seemed to be to
  sync the freeze changes with the timer check in A_Tracer(), so that's what
  I did: Freeze mode only changes every four tics now.
- Added IWAD-based [*.Autoload] ini support for games that have more than one
  IWAD. They are:
  * [Doom1.Autoload]
  * [Doom2.Autoload]
  * [Plutonia.Autoload]
  * [TNT.Autoload]
  * [HexenDK.Autoload]
  These are loaded after the more general game-specific [Doom.Autoload] and
  [Hexen.Autoload] sections if those are present.
- Changed the banner texts for the Final Doom IWADs to identify them as Final
  Doom rather than as DOOM 2. I know this differs from the original behavior,
  but they're marketed as Final Doom, not Doom 2.
- New: On Windows, the game now checks the registry to see if you have Steam
  installed. If so, it checks your SteamApps directory for any IWADs you may
  have purchased through Steam and adds any it finds to the list of available
  IWADs you can play. This means that if you bought your id games through
  Steam, you can just extract ZDoom anywhere you like and run it without doing
  any additional setup.
- Fixed: The FLAC/makefile.mgw should use md5.o as an OBJ, not md5.c.
- Fixed: The Linux makefile probably shouldn't be using the bundled zlib headers,
  either.

December 6, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's submission for scoreboard enhancement.
- Fixed: A_PainDie and A_DualPainAttack could fail to spawn the correct actor
  if the first spawned one died and executed some code in its death state.

December 5, 2007
- Fixed: The Linux makefile should use the include files for the system FLAC
  installation, not the bundled copies which might not match what is installed.
- Upgraded bundled FLAC from version 1.1.2 to version 1.2.1.

December 2, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Karate Chris's submission for 'allowrespawn' MAPINFO option.
- Added Karate Chris's submission for customizable skill confirmation text.
- Fixed: Doom's statusbar only checked for primary attacks, not secondary ones when
  setting Doomguy's face. (Thanks to Karate Chris for the fix.)

November 29, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added Skulltag's FORCEYBILLBOARD and FORCEXYBILLBOARD flags to the DECORATE parser.
  Even though the software renderer has no use for them it is necessary to support them
  so that mods can use these flags without becoming incompatible with ZDoom.

November 28, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- after looking at the most recent Vavoom update I realized that A_FastChase should not
  use the multi-purpose special2 as counter for strafing so I added a new variable
  for this purpose.

November 24, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added Floor_MoveToValue and Ceiling_MoveToValue action specials.

November 19, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed first name from 'none' to ''. The internal constant is still NAME_None,
  though.
- Fixed: Picking up a backpack incorrectly set the maximum amount for any ammo
  type that didn't have a BackpackMaxAmount to 0.

November 18, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed TableShit0 definition.

November 13, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed Berserk pickup sound.
- Fixed: When the DONTMOVE flag for A_Chase was used, movecount was not decreased
  resulting in missile attacks not working.
- Fixed: Hitscan attacks used the puff's position to calculate the trajectory for
  weapon kickback.

November 11, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The FMOD stream player must specify whether it wants to play the
  sound looped or not when playback is started, not when the stream is created.
- Fixed: A_Saw didn't use the puff's damage type.
- Fixed: The AxeBlood's death state was using the wrong sprite frame.

November 10, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Mancubus had an attack sound defined even though it shouldn't.

November 9, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: ACS's CheckWeapon must do a case insensitive string comparison to 
  compare the weapon name with the ready weapon's type.

November 8, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed PowerFlight so that Hexen's infiniteness is not controlled by being
  in a hub but by a level flag instead.

November 7, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Floor and ceiling huggers must set themselves to floor and ceiling each
  time they move.
- Added a LEVEL_NOMONSTERS flag so that G_ChangeLevel doesn't have to mess with
  the dmflags CVAR to start the level without monsters.

November 4, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Backpacks didn't increase the ammo capacity to BackpackMaxAmount if
  an ammo type's BackpackAmount was 0.
- Fixed some minor bugs in custom skill code.

November 3, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added text color options to menu code so that the skill definitions can set
  the color of the menu's text.
- Externalized skill settings to ZDoom.pk3

November 2, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added skill definitions to MAPINFO.

October 29, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added two new things which can set a sector's color without the need of tags
  or scripts. ColorSetter (#9038) sets the sector's color and FadeSetter (#9039)
  sets the fog color.
- added new flags MF5_ALWAYSFAST and MF5_NEVERFAST. These flags unconditionally
  enable or disable fast movement logic, regardless of skill settings.
- added an abstraction layer for skill related settings. This is a preparation
  for implementing custom skill definitions but right now all it does is
  returning the original values but keeping the related information all in one
  place

October 28, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The pointer cleanup code must also check a sector's sky box pointers.

October 27, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Right after teleporting P_SlideMove could cause player movement.
  Added a check for reactiontime to prevent that.
- Fixed: PainChances and Damagefactors were never freed.
- Added option to A_Chase that prevents the monster from moving.
- Fixed: The stained glass shards were missing the HEXENBOUNCE flag.

October 20, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added some NULL pointer checks to AActor::GiveAmmo.
- Fixed: The FSwordMissile was missing the special damage handling that
  reduces damage when hitting a player.

October 19, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: APlayerPawn::UpdateWaterLevel must check if the actor is still
  connected to a player.
- Fixed: POwered up weapons with a different ready state than their base
  weapon didn't change back when the powerup expired.
- Fixed: The powered up version of Heretic's Gauntlets missed the proper
  state assignments for Ready, Lower and Raise.

October 17, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Strife player was missing its pain state.

October 12, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Revenant missiles couldn't home in on targets with a height lower than
  40.
- Fixed: The code which checked for hitscan traces hitting actors from above
  and below must test whether the calculated hit position is actually inside 
  the actor being checked. If it crosses the top/bottom plane outside the
  bounding box there can't be a hit.
- Changed: State labels in code pointer calls must now be enclosed in quotation marks.
  This was done to ensure compatibility with parsers that will parse these as
  identifier-aware script code later.

October 8, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The code that checked hitscans entering an actor from above and below
  calculated the hit position wrong.

October 5, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Tne Imp's raise state sequence was wrong due to a typo.
- Fixed: The shotgun had spawn ID 21 instead of 27.
- Fixed: All 3 states in the DoomUnusedStates actor need to end with a 'stop'.

October 3, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The DECORATE TakeInventory functions didn't check the IF_KEEPDEPLETED
  flag.

September 29, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: ClearInventory should leave ammo in the inventory because it might be
  referenced by undroppable weapons.
- Fixed: Several functions in a_artifacts.cpp were missing a check for a valid
  owner.
- Fixed: sc_man counted lines wrong when ungetting strings but getting tokens
  next.

September 27, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: When I changed the scaling of textures to full fixed point precision
  I forgot to change the call that draws the automap marker numbers.
- Fixed: The chaingun-flash-checking code always checked the first player,
  not the calling one.
- Fixed: Hitscan traces didn't hit actors when entering from above or below
- Fixed: The DECORATE expression evaluator was reading the operator token
  from the wrong variable in a few places resulting in incorrect calculations.
- Fixed: MP3/OGG music always looped because the looping flag was always
  set when FMOD was called to play it.
- Removed upper limit of 1 for an actor's gravity factor.
- Fixed: A_VileTarget spawned the fire at coordinate (target->x, target->x)
  instead of (target->x, target->y). (Old vanilla bug.)

September 26, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: F_StartFinale shouldn't get the information if the game is about
  to end from level.nextmap. For example, this check is wrong for a secret
  exit.

September 25, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: AActor::CopyFriendliness must not copy the target if it has the 
  MF3_NOTARGET flag set.
- Fixed: Picking up weapons in deathmatch gives 2.5 times as much ammo as
  in other modes.

September 23, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: The #include command in DECORATE always tried to look up the name
  as a normal WAD lump name. It only should do that if the name is not longer
  than 8 characters and doesn't contain any '/'-characters.

September 11, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: The Timidity player didn't close its temporary files and left them
  behind because it couldn't delete them.
- added a $MidiDevice option to SNDINFO which can either set the preferred
  MIDI device for a song to Timidity or Windows' standard MIDI device.
  The reason for this: About 80% of my MIDI music collection sounds better
  with Timidity and the other 20% with Windows' standard synth and I'd like
  to be able to use each with the one that sounds better. For MUS files you
  can also force the use of OPL playback.

September 8, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added telefrag option to A_SpawnItemEx.

September 5, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Several options while changing maps only worked for the regular exit
  but caused problems when used with the secret exit. Rewrote the code to
  set the next map at the beginning and removed all subsequent parts that
  tried to resolve it from the original data again.

August 19, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: dumpmap crashed when used outside a map.

August 10, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Exported A_DeQueueCorpse to DECORATE. It seems I forgot this when exporting
  A_QueueCorpse.

August 9, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved setting of gameskill from M_ChooseSkill to G_DoNewGame because it
  doesn't work in M_ChooseSkill when the full console is open.

July 28, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: The BFGBall's explosion sequence was missing a state.
- fixed: The brown Chaos Serpent in Hexen had an incorrect sprite for its
  ice death sequence set.
- fixed: Ammo upon game start does not get multiplied when on easy skill.
  Implementing this as an inventory flag IF_IGNORESKILL also allows to create
  ammo/weapon/backpack types that don't multiply the ammo given when on this
  skill.

July 24, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- moved Doom exit sounds into SNDINFO as $random definitions.

July 18, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Dying Lost Souls could be reset to their see state if they slammed into
  something.

July 12, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added DTA_TopOffset and DTA_LeftOffset values to the automap background drawer.
- Fixed: DECORATE color translations with explicit colors didn't work because the
  code treated byte values as fixed point.
- Fixed: LEVEL_NOALLIES must clear MF_FRIENDLY off any spawned actor except players.
  Otherwise it doesn't work properly.
- Fixed: Entering a backslash in the player's name box caused a crash because 
  the code analyzing the string was missing a NULL pointer check.
- Fixed: Thing_Hate and Teleport_ZombieChanger unconditionally made state jumps,
  even for dead monsters.
- Fixed: The palette flash for item pickup was not reset upon a player's death.
- Fixed: P_DamageMobj tried to get damage multiplier information from the
  damage inflictor, not the attacker.
- Fixed: PowerTimeFreezer::DoEffect did not call its superclass method.
- fixed: When morphed monsters died they tried to set MF3_STAYMORPHED for the
  attacker, not themselves. This caused a crash when they were killed by a crusher.

May 28, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Split thingdef.cpp into several files so that the state and property code
  no longer gets in the way of the main parser.
- Changed A_MissileAttack, A_MeleeAttack and A_ComboAttack so that they use
  metadata. Now all the hack code associated with these functions can be removed.
- Fixed: deadthings.txt contained a superfluous ';' which created parsing errors
  with my changed code.
- Cleaned up DECORATE parser a little - moved the old style parsing code into its 
  own file and rearranged a few things.
- Made ProcessStates non-static so that it doesn't need to be passed as an argument
  to all functions in the DECORATE parser.
- Moved DECORATE parser files into their own subdirectory.
- Optimization: SC_GetToken no longer sets sc_name for identifiers. In most cases
  this creates needless overhead by adding a potentially unneeded name to the name
  table and looking up the name. In almost all cases where a name is needed it's as
  easy to assign sc_String to the name variable.
- Added enum definitions to DECORATE.

May 27, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Hirestex replacements for sprites didn't work properly due to some
  incorrect calculations in R_ProjectSprite.
- Fixed: The speed definition of PowerSpeed used PROP_SpeedFixed instead of
  PROP_SpeedLong.
- Fixed: The Chainsaw's kickback was initialized to the default - not 0.

May 26, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Resurrecting a player must set mo->special1 to 0 because it is used 
  as a counter by the Hexen fighter's fist weapon.

May 25, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Wraithwerge's spirits shouldn't attack friends.
- Fixed: The Heresiarch's balls must not adjust their z-position after the
  Heresiarch dies.

May 24, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added damage type specific pain chances and an MF5_NOPAIN flag that can be used
  to suppress entering the pain state altogether.
- Changed font initialization so that you can define replacements for the default
  fonts in FONTDEFS.
- Removed the 'add a bot' menu option since bots are beyond repair and therefore
  mostly useless.
- Fixed: Hitscan attacks must always spawn a puff so that it and its properties
  can be used as damage inflictor.
  
May 20, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Copied railgun sound fix from Skulltag.

May 19, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Made infighting a level flag. The old method still exists but the level flags
  will take precedence if set.

May 13, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: meleethreshold only has meaning when the attacking monster actually
  has a melee attack.
- copied a colormap fix from Skulltag.

May 12, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a compatibility option to restore the original behavior of the Invisibility 
  powerup.
- Changed: Weapons are no longer checked for the EXTREMEDEATH and NOEXTREMEDEATH flags.
  For all damage related actions it will always be the projectile (or puff for hitscan
  attacks) that is treated as the damage inflictor.
- Fixed: Hexen's fourth weapons made extreme death depend on the weapon the player
  is holding, not the projectile that did the kill. The WIF_EXTREME_DEATH flag
  no longer exists as a result.
- Expanded PowerSpeed so that subclasses can be derived that alter the speed factor.
- Added an MF5_USESPECIAL flag that allows using things to execute their specials.
- added MF4_FORCERADIUSDMG flag so that exploding items can be created which
  are able to hurt boss monsters.
- moved ML_BLOCK_PLAYERS to the value 0x4000 to bring it in line with Skulltag's 
  implementation.

May 9, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added Skulltag's custom F1 help screen MAPINFO option.

May 4, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Resurrecting a player must restore all flags words, not just the first one.
- Fixed: APowerWeaponLevel2::EndEffect must check PendingWeapon for WP_NOCHANGE.

May 3, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added Skulltag's high jump rune as a powerup

May 2, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Skulltag's Drain and Regeneration runes as powerups and used specific player
  sounds for their sound effects instead of using misc/i_pkup.
  (If I ever decide to implement runes it will be in a way that can use the regular
  powerups instead of having to define specific classes for them.)
- Added Skulltag's PowerQuadDamage and PowerQuarterDamage as more customizable
  PowerDamage and PowerProtection. These new powerups allow free customization of
  the damage modification per damage type by inheriting from these classes and
  setting specific values. Such derived damage/protection powerups will be considered
  as separate powers so that for example a QuadDamage and a DoubleDamage item can be
  stacked which would result in 8x damage.
  
May 1, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- merged player_t::cheats and player_t::Powers into one variable.
- Fixed: player_t::Powers was not saved in a savegame.
- Removed all unused PW_* player power flags.
- Added Skulltag's TimeFreezer powerup.
- Moved most of the menu strings (except options and player setup menu) into the
  string table.

April 30, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: GetLumpOffset must call SetLumpAddress when being called for uncompressed
  Zip entries.
- Fixed: Some of Doom's weapon obituaries didn't have the $-prefix that indicates a 
  reference to the string table.
- Fixed: The check for a valid weapon's spawn state for weapon dropping was incorrect.

April 29, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Increased precision of texture scaling factors to full fixed point. In the process
  I got rid of the old tx and ty CVARs because they made the texture scaling
  much more complicated than it was actually needed (and besides, they were completely
  useless except for testing purposes anyway.)
- Added a simple check for abstract weapon classes so that I can properly define
  the DoomWeapon base class.
- Fixed: When the Tome of Power runs out it must also set any pending weapon
  back to their regular state.
  
April 27, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added damage factors that allows to make monsters more or less resistant
  to specific damage types.
- Changed Dehacked parser to use the DECORATE symbol tables for code pointers
  instead of creating its own ones.

April 26, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed the HandleNoSector hack and changed A_Look so that it uses the sector's
  sound target for actors with MF_NOSECTOR regardless of compatibility settings.
- Moved initialization of weapon slots after the actor initialization.
  With default weapons exported to DECORATE it can't be done earlier.
- Converted Doom weapons to DECORATE.
- Changed backpack definition so that Doom's backpack is no longer the base
  class that implements its functionality. Now there is an abstract base class
  all backpack-like items derive from. Also moved the actual definition of Doom's
  backpack to DECORATE.

April 22, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added a CANUSEWALLS flag which allows a monster to activate 'use' specials
  like doors. This flag is on by default for any monster which was the
  previous behavior.
- Optimized the DECORATE flag parser so it can more efficiently handle
  the deprecated flags. As a side effect of this optimization the deprecated
  flags became usable in A_ChangeFlag again.
- Changed LONGMELEERANGE flag into a MeleeThreshold property.
- Changed SHORTMISSILERANGE flag into a MaxTargetRange property.
- Added Thing_Stop action special.
- Changed ACS's SetActorState so that it isn't limited to only one sublabel.
  This change also enables the implicit mapping of the old special death
  state names.
- Fixed: ShowErrorPane deleted the StartScreen instead of just calling
  NetDone.
- moved the DIM_MAP define into v_palette.h so that it can be accessed
  from outside the status bar code.
- Fixed: The check for non-swimmable water in UpdateWaterLevel checked for
  SECF_UNDERWATER instead of SECF_UNDERWATERMASK.
  
April 12, 2007
- Switched ACS world and global arrays to the TMap class instead of
  TAutoGrowArray. A map can handle a wide range of key values better than
  an array.

April 10, 2007
- Added a templated associative array class, TMap, that uses Lua's "chained
  scatter table with Brent's variation" algorithm. I had considered using
  hash_map until I discovered that it's not standard STL, and there are two
  major but incompatible implementations of it. So I rolled my own, and Lua
  seemed like a good place to go to for an efficient algorithm, since it
  makes heavy use of tables.

March 28, 2007
- Fixed some const char * -> char * conversions flagged by GCC 4.2.0 in the
  Win32-specific code.
- Fixed: The Win32 neterror() should return a const char *.
- Adding blinky text to the ENDOOM screen.

March 24, 2007
- Changed MakeKey's hash algorithm from a CRC32 to Paul Hsieh's SuperFastHash.

March 20, 2007
- Moved the implementation for the Thing_Damage special into another function
  so that I can create the ACS function Thing_Damage2. It's exactly the same as
  Thing_Damage, except the damage type is specified by name. When I did this,
  I noticed that it didn't do anything useful for a TID of 0, so I made it
  affect the activator in that case.

March 19, 2007
- Added a new SetActorState ACS function:
    int SetActorState (int tid, str statename, optional bool exact);
  If tid is 0, it affects the script activator, otherwise it affects all the
  matching actors. Statename is the name of the state you want to put the
  actor in. The final parameter, exact, specifies whether or not partial
  state name matches are accepted. If you don't specify it or set it to
  false, if you try to do something like:
    SetActorState (0, "Foo.Bar");
  And the actor has a Foo state but no Foo.Bar state, it will enter the Foo
  state. If you set exact to true:
    SetActorState (0, "Foo.Bar", true);
  Then the actor must have a Foo.Bar state, or it will not change state at
  all, even if it has a Foo state.
  The return value for this function is the number of actors that successfully
  changed state. Note that you should refrain from using this function to
  enter special states such as Death, or unpredictable results could occur.

March 13, 2007
- Fixed: Morphed players did not regain their innate armor when unmorphing.
  (Only Hexen has players with innate armor, under normal conditions.)

March 12, 2007
- Changed the default player.startitem amount from 0 to 1.

March 9, 2007
- Converted the TTY startup screen to a class for Linux.

March 8, 2007
- Increased the limit for the SorcererBallPop to 3 to be inline with the
  other Heresiarch ball sounds.
- Fixed: In Strife, using the shadow armor a second time while it is still
  active should make you completely invisible and your first-person weapon
  inverse grayscale.

March 7, 2007
- Changed P_SpawnPlayerMissile() to use the same height calculation as
  P_(Aim)LineAttack().
- Added an AttackZOffset to PlayerPawn. This is the offset from the
  center of the player at which their attacks are fired and scales
  according to their crouched height.
- Changed the version of P_SpawnPlayerMissile() that takes coordinates
  to use that location as an offset from the standard attack location
  rather than as an explicit attack location.
  
March 6, 2007
- Added an IF_KEEPDEPLETED flag for inventory items to keep them in the
  player's inventory even when they have been used up. If the item also
  has an inventory bar icon, it will be drawn darkened while it is
  depleted.

March 5, 2007
- Fixed: Thing_ProjectileAimed did not set the missile's speed correctly.

March 3, 2007
- The net start pane is now given focus when it is created, so it can
  receive keyboard input.
- Added playback of the "WeaponPickup" sound when a Hexen net game starts.
- Separated the different startup screens into classes for better
  modularization (which I should have done in the first place).

February 28, 2007
- Changed the net start pane to open underneath the existing window instead
  of scrunching the startup screen up to make room for it.
- Added the red net notches for Hexen's startup screen.
- Added hprintf and status simulation for Heretic's startup screen.
- Fixed: When I converted the P_Thing_Projectile() code for target leading
  to use the new vector routines, I had made dist calculate the squared
  length of the aim vector instead of the correct length.
- Fixed: When starting a new game from the menu while the fullscreen console
  was open, the game was frozen before its initial setup tick until the
  console was closed. The most obvious result of this is that your view was
  stuck on the floor until the console closed.
- Fixed: Pressing ESC while editing your player name completely cleared the
  menus instead of simply canceling the name change.
- Fixed: The status bar still showed the rampage face if you held the fire
  button down while frozen.

February 24, 2007
- Added << operators for FString that function exactly like +=, except they
  are left-associative, so you can use them like you would with an ostream
  and append to a string in a single expression without any overhead from
  allocating temporary strings as would happen if you used the + operator.
  In other words, instead of this:
     string += "Some string " + "that is assembled" + " in parts";
  You can do this and be more efficient while still being just as readable:
     string << "Some string " << "that is assembled" << " in parts";
- Changed PCD_PRINTBIND to include the command in its output if it isn't
  bound.
- Fixed: ACS_ExecuteWithResultValue could not be used inside a script because
  DLevelScript::RunScript() was not reentrant, thanks to having a global stack.
  The stack should be local to each instance of RunScript.
- Fixed: rt_draw4cols() could get stuck in rare situations where it thinks it
  should be drawing something but doesn't. Since long-term I plan to just
  replace all the masked drawing the variants of maskwallscan, I'm not going
  to try and find the real cause and fix it there. Instead, it just detects
  the situation and bails out when it finds it.

February 24, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: In the Doom2 cast finale it was impossible to toggle the console.
- Added APROP_Friendly actor property for ACS.
- Added a new flag, MF2_DONTREFLECT that prevents missiles from being reflected.
- Fixed: ALoreShot::DoSpecialDamage must check whether the shooter is still
  present. If it had been removed before the projectile hits its target
  a crash could occur.
- Fixed: GetPlayerInfo was missing breaks and always returned 0 as a result.
- Added Grubber's submission for printing key bindings in ACS.

February 19, 2007
- Fixed: $Ambient SNDINFO commands zeroed the AmbientSound structure, which
  is a no-no when using FString.
- Fixed: DEM_WIPEON/OFF commands should be ignored during demo playback and
  not pause the game, or the whole thing will be out of sync.
- Fixed: Playing a demo in windowed mode no longer grabs the mouse.

February 14, 2007
- Added two new net commands: DEM_WIPEON and DEM_WIPEOFF. They keep track of
  when a player is going through a screen wipe and act like a pause, so the
  game doesn't run several tics afterward to catch up with it.
- Fixed: EV_Teleport() did not set players to their idle state, so if they
  were running when the teleported, they would still be running afterward
  even though they weren't moving anywhere. Normally, P_XYMovement() does
  this when they stop due to friction.
- Fixed: AActor::TakeSpecialDamage() completely bypassed the standard rules
  for target switching on actors with MF5_NODAMAGE set.
- Changed the return values of the ACS spawn, spawnspot, and spawnspotfacing
  commands to be the total count of things spawned, rather than a pretty
  much useless reference to the actor spawned at the last map spot.
- Fixed: DLevelScript::DoSpawn() takes a byte angle, but DoSpawnSpotFacing()
  passed it a full-length angle.
- Fixed: When MF_SKULLFLY is removed because an actor slams into something,
  it was set to a see or spawn state, resetting its tic count and bypassing
  the effectiveness of the MF2_DORMANT flag. While I was at it, I decided
  dormant skulls shouldn't do slamming damage, either.
- Fixed: P_Thing_Spawn() returned success only if all thing instances were
  successfully spawned. As long as at least one thing was spawned, it should
  be considered a success.
- Fixed: Flipped single rotation sprites were only flipped every other 22.5
  degree interval.
- Fixed: S_ClearSoundData() did not stop any channels before freeing the
  samples, a problem for the alternate sound renderer if it happened to be
  playing any sounds at the time, since it would try to keep on playing them.

February 12, 2007
- Added two new cvars (win_x and win_y) that keep track of the window
  position when not playing in fullscreen mode.
- Changed the upper-left window positioning that was always used in debug
  builds into a command line option (-0), so debug and release builds behave
  the same.

February 10, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed earthquake code to not add all the intensities but use the maximum
  in DEarthQuake::StaticGetQuakeIntensity. The reason for this: Quakes were
  never supposed to be additive. Many maps, including Hexen's own have placed
  quake spots so that they cover a larger area but the areas covered by the
  single spots overlap. On such maps the view will shake like crazy and
  render the map nearly unplayable.

February 4, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The powered up Mace was missing its HoldAtkState.
- Added: Using "*" with ACS's music commands will play the level's default 
  music set in MAPINFO.

February 3, 2007
- Added two new MAPINFO flags to control what actor activates impact lines:
    * MissileShootersActivateImpactLines - the current behavior.
    * MissilesActivateImpactLines - the original Hexen behavior.
- Fixed: The changecamera special should remove "past viewer" information
  from the renderer in case the camera changed position or direction since
  the last time it was looked through. Otherwise, the renderer will
  interpolate from its previous view for one frame when it is switched to.
- Removed the 63-character limit on sound names.
- Reduced the rate at which drowning damage increases.
- Added more player water sounds:
    *dive - Played when your head goes below water.
    *surface - Played when your head goes back above water.
    *gasp - Played when you were drowning and get your air back.
  If your head surfaces and you were drowning, only *gasp plays, not both.
- Added damage-specific player death sounds, in the same fashion as the
  damage-specific player pain sounds. It looks for a sound with a name like
  "*death-damagetype" first and then "*death" if the first sound didn't exist.
- Removed the constraint that player sounds must be reserved before they can
  be assigned. Hence, the $playerreserve command has been eliminated, because
  it is no longer needed and it was never accessible from user wads, so I
  don't need to worry about breaking anything by removing it.

February 2, 2007
- Added a new fixrtext tool that sets the IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE flag for
  .rtext sections in the assembly object files. Now I can avoid doing this at
  runtime, which means that ZDoom is now UPX-compatible if anyone wants to
  pack it.
  
  You will need to do a rebuild or manually delete the old assembly .obj files
  for the first build from this revision to succeed, since there are no
  changes to the assembly files themselves, and the build process will not be
  able to automatically detect that they need to be rebuilt.
- Fixed: The SafeDivScales used a signed shift for their if test. This fails
  when a == 0x80000000, because the result of abs will still be negative as
  long as we use signed math.
- Fixed: SafeDivScale31 performed DivScale32 instead.
- Fixed: R_DrawSpanP_ASM had a short jump into a different section.

January 30, 2007
- Fixed: When quiting from fullscreen mode, RestoreConView() did not ungrab
  the mouse.
- Fixed an old Doom bug: Firing the chaingun with only one bullet still made
  it play its sound twice.
- Added an operator += for FString that takes an FName as input, since GCC
  is unable to synthesize one.
- Converted xlatcc to use lemon during its build process. Now you don't need
  bison to rebuild everything anymore.

January 27, 2007
- Added support for damage-specific player pain sounds.
- Removed the constraint that all $playerreserve SNDINFO commands must come
  before the other $player commands.
- Fixed: TArray::Reserve did not construct its newly allocated entries.
- Changed the damage type for drowning from 'Water' to 'Drowning'.
- Fixed: Since FMemLump is now implemented on top of FString, it never
  contains a NULL point, so the GetMem() method should fake it by
  returning NULL when the string is empty. Reverted p_xlat.cpp to its
  old revision.

January 26, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The rewrite of FMemLump broke the non-standard use of it in 
  P_TranslateLinedefs.
- Fixed: ShowErrorPane can be called before ST_NetDone is valid so it has to
  check whether it is NULL.
- Fixed: The Megasphere had an incorrect pickup sound.

January 25, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The new video initialization code could set the screen's Font pointer
  to NULL, causing a crash with levels that start in a secret sector.

January 24, 2007
- Fixed: If you called the FString assignment operator that accepts a
  const char * with a string inside its buffer, it released the buffer
  before copying the string.
- Added a new FString constructor that creates the string from a lump.

January 23, 2007
- Fixed: G_DoReborn() calls G_InitNew() with mapname set to level.mapname.
  G_InitNew() then copies it onto level.mapname, which is undefined
  behavior (although it does work as we want it to).
- Modified FMemLump to store its data using FString. That class provides
  a convenient method of storing reference counted data, so now FMemLump
  doesn't need to muck about sneakily using const_casts and possibly
  tricking its users into thinking that an old one is still valid after
  being assigned to a new one.
- Fixed: The IMGZ, PNG, PCX, and JPEG loaders assumed the files were
  large enough for their headers without actually checking.

January 22, 2007
- Fixed: The simulated palette blends when the menu or console are open
  were applied even when the status bar wasn't drawn. (In other words, even
  in situations where a real palette blend wouldn't have happened.)
- Added a range check for the PNG grAb chunks.
- Fixed: AddLine() could corrupt memory if the length of the text being
  added was longer than the console buffer.
- Fixed: FTexture::GetScaled(Left|Top)Offset returned the Width and Height
  instead when the scale values were 0.
- Removed the unnecessary "mov ecx,c" from mscinlines.h:Scale().
- Fixed: The simulated palette blend used when the console is down needs to
  force a full screen update the next frame.
- Fixed: LocalViewPitch could overflow and wrap around when a netgame stalls.
- Changed the vertheight and rounding-error-checking code in
  DCanvas::DrawTexture() to calculate off the actual bottom of the image
  instead of the height, improving precision. Now the scaled status bar is
  flush with the bottom of the screen at 1280x1024, for instance.
- Added a new WIF_NO_AUTO_SWITCH flag for weapons that should never be
  switched to automatically when the player picks them up.

January 18, 2007
- Added D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE to the IDirect3D9::CreateDevice() call.
  Normally Direct3D sets the FPU to single precision. We don't want that,
  since it can mean going out of sync with machines that are using the
  standard precision. Additionally, the nodebuilder requires the extra
  precision that single precision lacks.
- Replaced the vector math routines with the ones I developed for the FP code.

January 15, 2007
- Added a summonfoe CCMD, which is analagous to summonfriend but forces the
  summoned creature to be hostile instead.
- Changed the default snd_output under Linux to OSS.
- Added a GTK+ version of the IWAD selection dialog box. That brings the
  Linux port one step closer to feature parity with the Windows version.

January 15, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- added Grubber's submission for customizable gravity per actor.

January 14, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: A_Jump didn't work for weapons or CustomInventory items.

January 13, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Adjusted AlterWeaponSprite so that it properly handles multiple
  invisibility powerups at the same time.

January 13, 2007
- Integrated the fatal error display into the text logger.
  Next: Figure out how to do all this fancy new startup window stuff with GTK+
  so Linux users don't feel left out.

January 12, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the StrifePlayer to DECORATE. Even though it requires exporting
  3 new code pointers without general use it was necessary to handle
  GiveDefaultInventory consistently for all players without the need to 
  subclass this function.
- Added a Player.RunHealth property to expose the StrifePlayer's behavior of
  not being able to run when its health is below 10.
- Changed APlayerPawn::GiveDefaultInventory so that it always adds a HexenArmor
  and a BasicArmor item to the inventory. If these items are not the first ones
  added to the inventory anything else that might absorb damage is not guaranteed 
  to work consistently because their function depends on the order in the inventory.
- Changed handling of APowerup's DoEffect so that it is called from the owner's
  Tick function, not the item's. This is so that the order of execution is
  determined by the order in the inventory. When done in the item's Tick function
  order depends on the global thinker table which can cause problems with the
  order in which conflicting powerups apply their effect. Now it is guaranteed
  that the item that was added to the inventory first applies its effect last.
- Fixed: Added checks for Speed==0 to A_Tracer and A_Tracer2 because this could
  cause a divide by zero.
- Fixed: P_MoveThing must also set the moved actor's previous position to
  prevent interpolation of the move.
- Fixed: APowerInvisibility and its subclasses need to constantly update
  the owner's translucency information in case of interference between different
  subclasses. Also changed Hexen's Cleric's invulnerability mode to disable
  the translucency effect if an invisibility powerup is active.

January 9, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Skulltag's REDMAP and GREENMAP.
- Fixed: The PlayerSpeedTrail must copy the player's scaling information
  (from Skulltag)
- Added r_maxparticles CVAR from Skulltag.
- Changed PCX loader so that it always loads the last 768 bytes of 8 bit graphics 
  as a palette

January 8, 2007
- Added escape code support to the echo CCMD, so you can use colors with it.
- Changed the color scheme for the startup log to light text on a dark
  background and added color support to it.
- When a fatal error occurs, the log window is now scrolled so the final
  lines are guaranteed to be visible.
- Fixed: ShowErrorPane() crashed if it was called before the main window was
  created.
- Removed the game title banner for the ENDOOM display and replaced it with a
  short prompt at the bottom of the window.
- Halved the number of times the Strife startup screen updates the progress
  bar so that it spends less time drawing and gets done loading faster.
- Fixed: The quad FBD3D draws to the screen was one pixel too tall.

January 7, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Sorting of files in Zips was broken.
- Ported GZDoom's deep water splash code so that splashes are handled properly
  in Boom maps with non-swimmable water.
- Changed ENDOOM CVAR so that there is an option to show only modified versions.

January 6, 2007
- Added simulation of Strife's startup screen.
- Switched from a 14-pixel tall VGA font to a 16-pixel tall one for the
  Heretic loading screen (and ENDOOM).

January 6, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added ENDOOM screen. It will only be shown when the game is exited via the
  main menu and there is an option to switch it off for those who don't want
  to wait.
  
January 5, 2007
- Added simulation of Heretic's startup screen.
- Changed copyright notice for i_main.cpp, since none of it is really id's
  code.

January 5, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added customizable border textures. They will be defined with the 
  MAPINFO keyword 'bordertexture' and are settable per map.
- Fixed: When used in DECORATE A_Explode must use A_ExplodeParms.
- Added custom label support to A_Chase. To enable resurrection from the
  customizable version I also moved all A_VileChase stuff into p_enemy.cpp.

January 4, 2007
- Added simulation of Hexen's startup screen (currently minus net notches).

January 2, 2007 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The ANIMATED parser must read the bytes for the speed as unsigned bytes.
- Fixed: The screen wipe must be disabled for Heretic's underwater ending. If
  not, the wipe will try to mix pictures with different palettes.

December 31, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Several actors for Doom were missing their spawn ID.

December 29, 2006
- Fixed: APlayerPawn::GiveDefaultInventory() used two different variables
  both named item.
- Switched ddraw.dll to be delay loaded. With D3D9 now being the default
  display code, this avoids wasting time loading DDraw if it isn't needed.

December 28, 2006
- Fixed: The Win32 I_FatalError() did not set alreadyThrown, so it could get
  stuck in an endless fatal error loop.
- Fixed: The SDL input code must convert the event.data1 to uppercase.
- Added more resolution options when playing windowed under SDL.
- Changed SDL mouse handling to be basically identical to the (non-DirectInput)
  Win32 code. The mouse is polled periodically and constantly warped to the
  center of the window. Despite what the SDL docs specify, SDL_WM_GrabInput()
  is apparently no longer a reliable means of obtaining continuous relative
  mouse motion events.
- Fixed: The non-Windows implementation of I_FindClose() did not check for -1
  handles.
- Fixed all the warnings from GCC 4.2, including a handful that were present in
  older GCCs.
- Fixed: The VC++ project was not set up to redefine RM using del in
  wadsrc/Makefile, nor did it use the makefile for cleaning.
- Added ST_NetMessage() for mixing miscellaneous messages with the network
  startup meter, since they get mixed in the same space on the Linux terminal
  and must be handled properly to avoid looking bad.
- Fixed the new network status display for the Linux terminal.

December 25, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the Communicator to DECORATE.
- Renamed the new armor properties to use the same names as Skulltag to avoid
  confusion. They still don't need a separate base class as in Skulltag though.
- Added Skulltag-type armor bonus that increases the max amount that can be given
  by other armor items.
- Separated all armor related code from a_pickups.cpp into a_armor.cpp.

December 24, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Replaced several calls to S_GetSoundPlayingInfo with S_IsActorPlayingSomething
  because S_GetSoundPlayingInfo cannot properly resolve player and random sounds.
- Fixed: S_IsActorPlayingSomething has to resolve aliases and player sounds.
- Took S_ParseSndSeq call out of S_Init. This doesn't work when parsing SNDINFO
  in D_DoomMain.
- Moved SNDINFO reading back to its old place after MAPINFO. This is necessary
  for Hexen's music definitions.
- Added new flag MF5_NOBLOODDECALS that prevents bleeding actors from spawning
  blood decals.

December 23, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Cacodemon doesn't have a melee attack defined as I mistakenly
  assumed when writing its DECORATE code.
- Fixed: Commander Keen's death sequence had one state duplicated.
- Fixed: Due to the changes for custom states the internal weapons shouldn't
  define a holdatk state unless it differs from the attack state.
- Fixed: The bot code tried to spawn ACajunBodyNode instead of CajunBodyNode.
- Changed: MF2_BLASTED doesn't work well for players so I had to take it out
  of A_BlastRadius.
- Fixed: When MF2_BLASTED was cleared MF2_SLIDE got cleared as well, no matter
  whether it was set by default or not. Now the MF2_SLIDE check checks both
  flags and the BlastRadius code doesn't set MF2_SLIDE anymore.

December 22, 2006
- Fixed: If anyone other than the most recently-connected player aborted
  during i_net handshaking, everybody who connected after them would have
  the wrong idea of what their player number was.
- Guests can now watch as other guests connect during i_net handshaking.
- Fixed: The host would let more than the desired number of players connect.
- Decreased the frequency of packets in ST_NetLoop() to two per second.
- Fixed: During the i_net handshaking, guests never verified that the messages
  they received were from the host.
- Removed the -net command line option. I'm not sure it even worked anymore.

December 20, 2006
- Turned on warning level 4 just to see what it would produce: a lot of
  warnings. At first, I was going to try and clean them all up. Then I decided
  that was a worthless cause and went about just acting on the ones that
  might actually be helpful:
   C4189 (local variable is initialized but not referenced)
   C4702 (unreachable code)
   C4512 (assignment operator could not be generated)

December 19, 2006
- Fixed: D3DFB::Reset() also needs to restore the texture border color,
  otherwise it gets reset to black and unused. 
- Fixed: I_SetWndProc() needs to be called before any of the DirectX
  interfaces are initialized, because DirectX subclasses the window itself,
  and I_SetWndProc() undoes that subclassing.

December 19, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Inventory.Icon printed error message for all the missing icons in 
  Strife's teaser.
- Fixed: st_start.cpp needed a 
  #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0501.
- Fixed a few uninitialized variables warnings for GCC.

December 18, 2006
- Reorganized the network startup loops so now they are event driven. There is
  a single function that gets called to drive it, and it uses callbacks to
  perform the different stages of the synchronization. This lets me have a nice,
  responsive abort button instead of the previous unannounced hit-escape-to-
  abort behavior, and I think the rearranged code is slightly easier to
  understand too.
- Increased the number of bytes for version info during D_ArbitrateNetStart(),
  in preparation for the day when NETGAMEVERSION requires more than one byte.
- I noticed an issue with Vista RC1 and the new fatal error setup. Even after
  releasing a DirectDraw or Direct3D interface, the DWM can still use the
  last image drawn using them when it composites the window. It doesn't always
  do it but it does often enough that it is a real problem. At this point, I
  don't know if it's a problem with the release version of Vista or not.
  After messing around, I discovered the problem was caused by ~Win32Video()
  hiding the window and then having it immediately shown soon after. The DWM
  kept an image of the window to do the transition effect with, and then when
  it didn't get a chance to do the transition, it didn't properly forget about
  its saved image and kept plastering it on top of everything else
  underneath.

December 16, 2006
- Added a network synchronization panel to the window during netgame startup.
- Fixed: PClass::CreateDerivedClass() must initialize StateList to NULL.
  Otherwise, classic DECORATE definitions generate a big, fat crash.
- Resurrected the R_Init progress bar, now as a standard Windows control.
- Removed the sound failure dialog. The FMOD setup already defaulted to no
  sound if initialization failed, so this only applies when snd_output is set
  to "alternate" which now also falls back to no sound. In addition, it wasn't
  working right, and I didn't feel like fixing it for the probably 0% of users
  it affected.

December 16, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The smartaim logic was incorrect. Also added another mode: Autoaim only
  at monsters.
- Merged FActorInfo::FindStateExact and FActorInfo::FindState into one function 
  because the differences are only minimal.
- Removed all the varargs FindState functions because they aren't really needed.
  The engine itself never explicitly checks for more than 2 labels and for the 
  rest a function that gets passed a FName array is more suitable anyway.
- Changed state label storage so that each actor owns all the state labels itself
  and doesn't have to traverse parent lists to find them. This is required for
  Dehacked actors that inherit states (e.g. NonsolidMeat and Spectre) but it also
  makes the data much easier to handle.
- Merged the fallingdamage setting into one menu item and added Strife damage to it.
- Moved deathmatch options into their own category in the gameplay options menu.
- Added the sv_smartaim code from GZDoom which tries to avoid autoaiming
  at friendlies or shootable decorations if there are monsters that can be shot.
- Added: SetThingSpecial treats a tid of 0 as the activator.

December 15, 2006
- Fixed: The edit control used for logging output added text in reverse order
  on Win9x.

December 13, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The particle fountains' names were different than before
- Fixed: FTexture::CheckForTexture should return NULL if the texture it
  finds is of type FTexture::TEX_Null. If this isn't done not all occurences
  of AASHITTY being used to silence an editor's error checker will be handled
  correctly. In particular the transparent door trick will break.

December 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: When a DehackedPickup replacement object is created it must copy
  the state labels of the parent object.

December 9, 2006
- Went back to the roots and made graphics initialization one of the last
  things to happen during setup. Now the startup text is visible again. More
  importantly, the main window is no longer created invisible, which seems
  to cause trouble with it not always appearing in the taskbar. The fatal
  error dialog is now also embedded in the main window instead of being a
  separate modal dialog, so you can play with the log window to see any
  problems that might be reported there.
  
  Rather than completely restoring the original startup order, I tried to
  keep things as close to the way they were with early graphics startup. In
  particular, V_Init() now creates a dummy screen so that things that need
  screen dimensions can get them. It gets replaced by the real screen later
  in I_InitGraphics(). Will need to check this under Linux to make sure it
  didn't cause any problems there.
- Removed the following stubs that just called functions in Video:
    - I_StartModeIterator()
    - I_NextMode()
    - I_DisplayType()
  I_FullscreenChanged() was also removed, and a new fullscreen parameter
  was added to IVideo::StartModeIterator(), since that's all it controlled.
- Renamed I_InitHardware() back to I_InitGraphics(), since that's all it's
  initialized post-1.22.

December 9, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: P_LookForTid should abort its search when it discovers that it has 
  cycled through the entire list of actors.
- Reverted AActor::FindState to its R407 version because the change in R408 
  doesn't compile properly with VC++.
- Changed FIXMAPTHINGPOS further so that it also affects objects that are 
  not directly on a wall but closer than its radius.
- Changed FIXEDMAPTHINGPOS to move objects completely out of the wall and 
  adjusted the radii of all affected objects to actually represent half 
  the sprite's width.

December 8, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Acolyte's obituary wasn't printed.
- Fixed: The fighter player's attack state used the Cleric's sprite.

December 5, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved A_ThrowGrenade from Inventory to Actor because it can also be used by
  monsters
- Added velocity multiplicators to A_SpawnDebris.
- Changed: A_JumpIfNoAmmo should have no effect for CustomInventory items.
- Fixed: DECORATE jump commands must set the call state's result to 0
  even when they have to return prematurely.
- Added obituaries for Strife's and Hexen's monsters.
- Converted Strife's Bishop to DECORATE.
- Added momx, momy and momz variables to the DECORATE expression evaluator.

December 3, 2006
- Modified the trustInfo for updaterevision.exe so that it should be
  fine even with the buggy mt.exe that comes with Visual C++ 2005.
  (Note that the Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2, and later
  versions of the Windows SDK also come with a working mt.exe that
  work fine with the old trustInfo.)

December 2, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the Heretic sound sequences and the particle fountains to DECORATE.
- Added DECORATE support for setting an actor's args. If this is done
  it will also disable the actor's special that can be set in a map. This
  is for actors that want to use A_CountdownArg or similar functions
  that use the args for something different than the special's parameters.
- Converted a_sharedmisc.cpp to DECORATE.
- Added a new NActorIterator that can search for classes specified by name.
- Added a new constructor to TThinkerIterator that can search
  for DECORATE defined subclasses that are not represented by a real C++ class.
- Fixed: BuildInfoDefaults must set the parent symbol table so that 
  all actors can get to the global symbols stored in AActor.
- Fixed some minor inconsistencies in the Arch-Vile's DECORATE definition.
- Fixed: A_VileAttack moved the flame without relinking it into the sector 
  lists. It also forgot to set the z-position correctly. (original Doom bug.)
- Fixed: The Doom 2 cast finale didn't work with the dynamic state name handling.

November 30, 2006
- Finished the framework for specifying all action functions externally,
  including restricting them to particular classes.
- Removed all the "fast" and unused code from FColorMatcher. Today's
  computers are fast enough that the difference isn't even noticeable
  unless you're doing hundreds of thousands of matches, and I never had
  any plans to improve the algorithm the "fast" code used.
- Fixed: BestColor() should not by default return 0 as a possible match,
  since it's normally the transparent color.
- The DSimpleCanvas constructor now fills MemBuffer with zeros.
- Fixed: If the FBTexture wasn't exactly the same size as the screen,
  D3DFB::PaintToWindow() would still lock it with D3DLOCK_DISCARD. Alas,
  I saw no speedup for using a dirty region. (Side note: The Radeons are
  apparently slower compared to DirectDraw because they must do
  power-of-2 textures. If they ever add non-power-of-2 support like nvidia,
  I assume they will also see a speed gain.)
- Changed fb_d3d9.cpp so that instead of trying to compensate for Geforce
  off-by-one errors in the pixel shader, it automatically detects where
  the error occurs and modifies the way the palette is uploaded to
  compensate. Palette color 255 is then represented using the texture
  border color instead of actually being part of the palette. This should
  work correctly with all cards, since I had a report of an FX where the
  off-by-one occurred in a different spot from the place where I observed
  it on a 6 and 7 series cards. Since the shader now has one fewer
  instruction, I notice a very marginal speedup. (Interestingly, removing
  the flash blending from the shader had no perceivable performance gain.)

November 29, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The DECORATE expression evaluator evaluated operators of same
  precedence right to left instead of left to right.
- Added global constants to DECORATE so that I can define meaningful flag 
  names for some DECORATE functions. Technically these will be constants 
  of the AActor class but that will make them accessible in all other actor 
  classes.
- Made the constructor of PSymbolTable inline. Having this a real function 
  adds 100kb to the EXE, mostly needless exception handling code.

November 28, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The StrifePlayer couldn't obtain his default inventory because
  APlayerPawn::GiveDefaultInventory gave him some HexenArmor even though
  he doesn't need it.
- Added custom blood type properties to DECORATE.
- Converted Blood to DECORATE and made some minor changes to the code
  in preparation for custom blood types.
- Converted the bot helper things to DECORATE.
- Added damage type specific crash states.

November 28, 2006
- Started adding action function declarations to objects.
- Added integer constant declarations to objects.
- Added some new token-based functions to sc_man.cpp that know about keywords
  and record proper type information, so parsers don't need to treat
  everything as strings.
- Added a simple symbol table to PClass.

November 27, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: When playing a shareware game no external WADs are loaded at all,
  not even zvox.wad or the skins directory.
- Minor improvement of Hexen's Demons: They now transfer the translation
  to the chunks they spawn so that they look correct if they are color
  translated. See Resurrection of Chaos for an example.
- Converted Key gizmos to DECORATE.
- Converted Heretic's Beast (Weredragon) to DECORATE.
- Added a randomness parameter to A_SpawnItemEx. This allows
  spawning objects with a random chance without the need to write
  complicated A_Jump constructs.
- Converted Heretic's Mummy to DECORATE.
- Converted Hexen's Demons to DECORATE.

November 26, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted Ettin and Centaur to DECORATE.
- Made the Ettin's and Centaur's howling sound an actor property.
- Added A_CustomComboAttack function to finally have something that can
  replace the old A_ComboAttack function.
- Added A_SpawnItemEx function that removes the problems with A_SpawnItem
  and which also should make most of the A_CustomMissile abuse unnecessary.
- Added A_QueueCorpse to the list of DECORATE code pointers.
- Made the size of Hexen's corpse queue configurable by CVAR
  (sv_corpsequeuesize.) Setting this CVAR to -1 will disable corpse 
  queuing completely so that even in Hexen all corpses will stay forever.
- Added random2 function to DECORATE's expression evaluator. This is to
  better emulate some calculation of internal code pointers.
- Added named RNG support to DECORATE's expression evaluator. Just use
  random[name](min, max).

November 25, 2006
- Reverted updaterevision.vcproj to r385 and added a note as a build event
  explaining the need to use mt.exe 6.0 or newer. Here is the note:
  VERY IMPORTANT: You must copy the mt.exe from %VSINSTALLDIR%\Common7\Tools\bin
  on top of the version in %VSINSTALLDIR%\VC\bin or your computer may restart
  while building.
- Changed the ASecretTrigger::Activate() fix: There's no reason open scripts
  shouldn't be able to activate secret triggers; players just won't get
  credit for it in coop.
- Added a NULL actor check to R_SetupFrame().
- Fixed: The player sounds in DEHSUPP were defined incorrectly.

November 25, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: SecretTriggers that were activated in an OPEN script caused a crash.
- Converted Heretic's Clink (Sabreclaw) to DECORATE.
- Added MissSound parameter to A_CustomMeleeAttack.
- Converted Heretic's Snake (Ophidian) to DECORATE.
- Added an option to A_CustomMissile to jump to the see state if
  the caller's target is dead.
- Fixed: A_ThrowGrenade didn't play the missile's spawn sound.
- Added MF_SPAWNSOUNDSOURCE flag so that Raven's missile spawning code 
  pointers can be recreated with DECORATE.
- Converted a_ravenambient.cpp to DECORATE.

November 24, 2006
- Fixed: The backpack didn't give extra ammo in baby and nightmare modes.
- Fixed: When P_SpawnPlayer() calls DObject::PointerSubstitution() to
  redirect player pointers, it affects the bodyque too. That meant that in
  multiplayer games, once the bodyque filled up, anybody was in danger of
  being rudely destroyed the next time somebody respawned.

November 22, 2006
- Added a manifest with a trustinfo section to updaterevision.exe so that
  the build process can run uninterrupted under Vista.
- Fixed: DIRECT3DCREATE9FUNC needs WINAPI added to its prototype so that it
  works properly in release build, which defaults to __fastcall.

November 20, 2006
- Fixed: Polyobjects are serialized before players, which means that a call
  to PO_MovePolyobj() from P_SerializePolyobjs() for a crushing polyobject
  that touches a player actor will not have a valid actor->player->mo chain
  for P_DamageMobj and crash if it happens to touch the player. Since the
  polyobject was presumably in a good spot when the game was saved, we can
  just skip this step entirely and let it take care of itself the next time
  it moves (by which time, the players will be valid).
- Fixed: When transitioning from fullscreen to windowed mode with D3DFB, the
  window kept the WS_EX_TOPMOST style.
- Slight correctness fix: When in fullscreen, the window should have WS_POPUP
  style.
- Added a NULL target check to P_SpawnMissileXYZ(), A_DemonAttack1(),
  A_DemonAttack2_1(), and A_DemonAttack2_2().

November 18, 2006
- Fixed: DFrameBuffer and related classes did not use DECLARE_CLASS macros,
  so there was no guarantee that they would allocate the proper amount of
  memory. This tripped me up when I was using D3DFB and it was writing beyond
  the end of allocated memory.
- Added a new D3DFB class that should be more compatible with modern systems
  than the 8-bit paletted DDrawFB.
  Pros:
    - Much cleaner code.
    - No performance penalty when running in a window.
    - Slightly faster fullscreen performance on Geforce 6 and 7 cards.
    - Vista ought to love it.
  Cons:
    - Requires Pixel Shader 1.4 or better.
    - Fullscreen on an ATI Mobility x300 is a little slower (but still faster
      than DirectDraw in a window).
  Note that this is not hardware accelerated rendering. The screen is still
  drawn as before by the CPU to an 8-bit paletted surface. The difference is
  in how that surface makes its way to the visible display. Here, the surface
  is copied to an 8-bit texture, and a pixel shader converts it to RGB when
  drawing it.

November 14, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Made AActor's xscale and yscale properties full precision fixed point
  so now larger scales than 4 can be done.

November 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a check to P_CheckMissileSpawn to decrease the monster counter
  if it was called for spawning a monster with A_CustomMissile.
- Added a ML_BLOCK_PLAYERS line flag.

November 5, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted Heretic's and Hexen's players to DECORATE.
- Made Hexenarmor factors configurable by DECORATE.
- Added support for selecting the invulnerability mode per item as well.
- Made Invulnerability and Healing radius behavior selectable by player
  class instead of hard coding the special behavior to the Hexen classes.
- Converted the DoomPlayer to DECORATE.
- Extended all A_Jump commands to take labels as parameters in addition
  to offsets.
- Removed the deprecation warnings for the state assignment commands
  in DECORATE. While it is still recommended not to use them anymore
  they will continue to work with custom state support and existing 
  DECORATE code doesn't have to be changed. However, they will remain
  limited to the existing functionality, nothing more.

November 4, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Replaced the static string buffer in ProcessStates with an FString.
- After doing some tests with state label scopes I had to conclude that
  using '.' both for separating sub-state-labels and scope resolution 
  identifiers does not work reliably unless all actor class names were
  prohibited from being used as state labels.  Since that is undesirable
  the only solution is to change the scope resolution operator. Fortunately 
  no WADs so far have used it so implementing such a breaking change isn't 
  a major issue. Now it uses '::', like C++ for this purpose.
- Converted Revenant, Mancubus and Pain Elemental to DECORATE.
- Converted Arachnotron, Archvile, Cyberdemon, Spidermastermind and
  CommanderKeen to DECORATE.
- Converted ExplosiveBarrel, BulletPuff and DoomUnusedStates to DECORATE.
- Added VSpeed DECORATE property so that an actor can be given an initial
  vertical speed.
- Removed the barrel check in P_DamageMobj. AActor::Die is doing the same
  operation unconditionally so this is redundant.
- Added A_BarrelDestroy to the list of DECORATE code pointers so that
  the same effect can be recreated for other items as well.
- Renamed A_BarrelRespawn to A_Respawn, changed it so that it works for
  monsters and added it to the list of DECORATE code pointers. Now Quake-style
  zombies should be possible. ;)
- Changed handling of MF4_RANDOMIZE so that it applies to all actors being
  spawned and not just projectiles.
- Converted Berserk and Megasphere to DECORATE.
- Fixed: HealThing should respect the stamina a player has and the Dehacked
  health compatibility flag if max is 0. To do that it calls P_GiveBody now.

November 1, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Cacodemon had a FastSpeed definition even though it shouldn't.
- Fixed: FastSpeed was used unconditionally when defined.

October 31, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: SetActorPitch with a 0-tid (i.e. affect the activator) set the angle
  instead of the pitch.
- Fixed: The check for special death states in AActor::TakeSpecialDamage didn't
  work.
- Fixed: The global WeaponSection string was never freed. It has been replaced
  with an FString now.
- Fixed: The music strings in the default level info were never freed and
  caused memory leaks when used repeatedly.
- Fixed: The intermusic string in the level info was never freed.
- Fixed: The default fire obituary should only be printed if the damage
  came from the environment. If it comes from a monster the monster specific
  obituary should be used instead.
- Added custom damage types from the floating point test release.
- Changed Pain Elemental's massacre check. Now A_PainDie checks for the damage 
  type and doesn't spawn anything if it is NAME_Massacre. A_PainDie can also 
  be used by other actors so a more generalized approach is needed than hard
  coding it into the Pain Elemental.
- Converted a few of Doom's monsters to DECORATE because I couldn't test the
  first version of the custom state code with the corpses inheriting from them.
- Added custom states from last year's floating point test release and fixed
  some bugs I found in that code. Unfortunately it wasn't all salvageable
  and it was easier to recreate some parts from scratch.

October 30, 2006
- Version bump to 2.1.7.
- Fixed: Placing a /* */ comment at the very end of a file without a
  terminating newline would not parse reliably.
- Added a NULL WallSpriteTile check to R_RenderDecal().

October 28, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed parameter storage for states to use a separate member variable
  instead of forcing it into misc1/misc2. Although this increases the EXE's
  size by 30k it has several advantages:
  * State parameters are no longer limited to 65535 for all states combined.
  * State parameters can be used with long durations.
  * Some special handling in the weapon state set functions can be removed.

October 26, 2006
- Removed A_JumpSet and merged its functionality with A_Jump by turning
  A_Jump into a varargs function.
- Fixed: P_MorphPlayer() should check that the desired type is actually a
  PlayerPawn.
- Added an optional parameter to the morphme ccmd that specifies the player
  class to morph into.
- Changed the SetActorPitch, SetActorAngle, Thing_Spawn*, Thing_Projectile*,
  and Thing_Move functions so that TID 0 affects the activator.

October 25, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The MinotaurFriend's MF4_NOTARGETSWITCH was put on AMinotaurFX1.
- Moved the sector type translation for Doom format maps into a simple lump 
  in zdoom.pk3.
- Changed Line_SetIdentification so that the fifth arg is a high-byte for the
  line ID.

October 23, 2006
- Added the A_JumpSet function for what seems to be a fairly common scenario.
  It is like A_Jump, except it accepts up to 20 jump targets. The jump
  probability is still the first parameter and controls whether any jump is
  taken at all; use 256 if you always want to jump. If a jump is taken, then
  one of the jump targets will be chosen at random, with each target having
  an equal chance of being chosen.
- Fixed: The unfreeze ccmd was not multiplayer-safe. And I renamed it to thaw,
  since it has nothing to do with the freeze ccmd.

October 22, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added MF5_PIERCEARMOR flag that allows damaging objects that aren't
  affected by armor.
- Added an unfreeze CCMD so that frozen players can be unfrozen for testing.
- Added special death states for projectiles hitting actors.
- Added ACS SetActorPitch/GetActorPitch functions.
- Added cameraheight property for actors.

October 21, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The yellow color range contained gaps in its definition which 
  resulted in incorrect colors.
- Fixed: FFont::BuildTranslations didn't clamp the RGB color values. This
  can happen if some font colors overflow or underflow due to incomplete
  range specifications.

October 20, 2006
- Fixed: ExpData::EvalConst() did not NULL the children pointers for binary
  operators after deleting them, so ~ExpData() would try to delete them again
  later.

October 19, 2006
- Added a new MapMarker actor. Instead of appearing in the 3D view, it appears
  on the automap instead. If its first argument is zero, the map marker itself
  appears on the automap, otherwise it is drawn on top of any actor with a TID
  matching that argument. If the second argument is one, then the map marker
  will only be appear if the player has previously seen the sector it is one.
  You can use Thing_Activate and Thing_Deactivate on markers to turn them on
  and off. And if you subclass MapMarker with DECORATE, you can easily make
  your own custom markers.
- Fixed: Map markers could not be drawn partially off the map. They were
  drawn either fully or not at all.
- Fixed: Map markers appeared in the wrong place on a rotated overlay map if
  screenblocks < 10.
- Added the MF2_PASSMOBJ for P_Thing_Spawn() from January 4, 2003, to
  DLevelScript::DoSpawn().
- Changed VectorNormalize() (and VectorNormalize2) to use doubles for storing
  the vector lengths, fixing desyncs between GCC/VC++ games that happened
  because the two compilers produced slightly different results for some
  slopes. GCC kept them in registers, so they were never truncated to floats.
  VC++ stored them to memory and reloaded them in order to truncate them to
  the defined precision. Lesson learned: Floating point numbers in local
  variables should always be doubles to produce the best code with VC++ that
  has the best chance of matching GCC's default behavior.
- Removed netget and netsend function pointers. PacketGet and PacketSend are
  now called directly.
- Fixed: Watching a demo from the point of view of someone other than the
  first player could cause a crash when the demo ended.
- Removed invcount from the expression evaluator at Grubber's suggestion,
  because it doesn't work.
- Fixed: vid_nowidescreen should fire off setsizeneeded so that changes to it
  can happen immediately instead of at the next resolution change.
- Modified the way autosaves are done. Instead of setting gameaction to
  ga_autosave, write DEM_CHECKAUTOSAVE to the net stream. When this is
  processed, it will check if it's okay to do an autosave. If it is, it writes
  DEM_DOAUTOSAVE to the net stream, which the sets gameaction to ga_autosave.
  Essentially, about half of the functionality was moved out of G_DoAutoSave()
  and into Net_DoCommand().
- Minor changes to OS detection: The os_WinNT enumeration has been renamed to
  os_WinNT4, since every new OS coming out of Microsoft these days is
  essentially NT. NT 5.2 and 6.0 are now properly identified as "Windows
  Server 2003" and "Windows Vista" respectively, and any unknown NT versions
  Microsoft introduces in the future will now be displayed as "Windows NT"
  instead of "Windows 2000" if the minor version is 0 and "Windows XP" if the
  minor version is non-0. Win32s detection has also been removed. Presumably
  if somebody is foolish enough to try to run this on Windows 3.x with Win32s,
  it won't even load due to missing DLLs.

October 15, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed the rocket so that the FX_ROCKET flag is set in the actor
  definition and not in BeginPlay.
- Changed the special explosion behavior of the rocket to a flag
  (MF5_DEHEXPLOSION) so that its effects can be used on other actors
  as well without having to inherit from the rocket.

October 9, 2006
- Fixed: Demos with NETD chunks should not set netgame to true unless they
  have more than one player. And since netdemo is ignored if netgame is
  false, it doesn't need to set that either.
- Fixed: FTexture::GetScaled* functions did not check for scale values of 0.

October 7, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PrintAlias passed FString objects directly to Printf.
- Added bitwise not (~) operator to ACS.

October 6, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Hires texture replacements must call AddPatch if the texture
  isn't defined yet in order to replace lumps that are not in the
  list of preinitialized graphics.
- Changed font initialization to occur after textures have been completely
  initialized. This is necessary so that the font characters can be
  replaced with hires versions.

October 5, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Hires texture replacements and auto-scaled flats require the 
  bWorldPanning flag. Also added some NULL pointer checks to the
  hires texture loading code.
- Added Sector_SetFloorScale2 and Sector_SetCeilingScale2 line specials.
  They are mostly the same as Sector_Set*Scale but take fixed point parameters.
  This makes them easier to use and more precise than the old ones which
  offered very small fractional precision.
- Changed Thing_Deactivate so that passing a tid of 0 deactivates the calling 
  actor.
- Added MeansOfDeath parameter to DamageThing.

October 4, 2006
- Added alias parameter substitution. Instances of %x in the alias command
  string will be replaced with parameter x when the alias is executed.
- Fixed: When FString::LockBuffer() had to create a new string because the
  RefCount was higher than one, the new string was not actually locked.
- FConsoleAlias now stores the commands in FStrings.
- BuildString() now returns an FString.
- Added the muslib license text to muslib.h.

October 4, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- When exiting the level on a damaging floor the player could be in the pain
  state and make its pain noise at the start of the next level.
- Fixed: The FPS counter obstructed the key display in Doom's fullscreen HUD.

October 2, 2006
- Fixed: V_BreakLines() failed to produce output for the final line if it was
  only one character long.
- Fixed: When players respawned in multiplayer, scripts that started on their
  old body kept executing on that body instead of being transferred to the new
  one. I'm doing this with general pointer substitution now, so everything
  that pointed to the old body will use the new one; not sure if that's best,
  or if it should applied exclusively to scripts, though.
- Fixed: Hexen's delay ACS command actually waited one extra tic. Now if
  you're playing Hexen and an old-style ACS script delays it will wait one
  extra tic in ZDoom as well.
- Fixed: When G_FinishTravel() created a temporary player, P_SpawnPlayer()
  thought the old player actor was a voodoo doll and stopped its scripts
  and moved its inventory.

September 30, 2006
- Fixed: player_t::GetSpawnClass() always returned the spawn flags for the
  local player, so co-op games would spawn only the things relevant for the
  local player and not all the things relevant for all players.

September 30, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Default flags for APlayerPawn and APlayerChunk were not defined.
- Fixed: The PCD_GETPLAYERINFO case in p_acs.cpp was missing a break.

September 27, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Monsters should never target friends, even if the friendliness
  state has changed since the target has been acquired.
- Fixed: Multiplayer telefrag obituaries must be handled before weapon
  dependent obituary messages.

September 26, 2006
- PClass::StaticInit() now sorts the class metadata so that operations that
  iterate over it (such as the "give all" cheat) are compiler-independant.

September 25, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: ACustomInventory::CallStateChain couldn't be called recursively
  so any item that was giving another CustomInventory item didn't work
  as intended.
- Fixed: CustomInventory items didn't process A_Jump... commands properly
  for non-players.

September 23, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Starting a new game didn't remove the deferred scripts.

September 22, 2006
- Fixed: FNodeBuilder::ShoveSegBehind needs to check that the result from
  Heuristic is positive, not just non-zero.

September 20, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Summoned friendly monsters added to the total kill count.

September 19, 2006
- Added a dialog that gives the user the chance to fix things if the config
  could not be saved for some reason.
- Added the writeini console command to write the config file, optionally
  specifying a specific file name for it.
- Fixed: "Multiplayer" demos that only had one player were not played back
  properly because the demo playback code only checked the number of players
  to determine if it should be played as a netdemo.
- Assembly code is disabled when building with __APPLE__ defined, for now.
- If you aren't targeting x86, m_fixed.h only includes basicinlines.h now.
- Moved x64inlines.h into basicinlines.h.
- Replaced uses of __int64 with types from doomtype.h.
- The stop console command no longer ends single player games, just the demo
  that was being recorded.
- In C mode, the sc_man parser no longer allows multi-line string constants
  without using the \ character to preface the newline character. This makes
  it much easier to diagnose errors where you forget the closing quote of a
  string.
- Fixed: V_BreakLines() added the terminating '\0' to the last line of the
  input string.
- Added font as a parameter to V_BreakLines and removed its keepspace
  parameter, which was never passed as anything other than the default.

September 18, 2006
- Removed REGEXEPEEK. It was only there for a Dev-C++ project, and the Dev-C++
  project was long ago removed, thanks to that particular IDE being so agonizingly
  slow.

September 17, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Texture scale calculations for HIRESTEX were incorrect.
- Fixed: The sky scrolling calculations caused an integer multiplication overflow.
- Fixed: Voodoo dolls should not start ENTER scripts.
- Fixed: ActorDamage must not parse the enclosing parentheses as part of the 
  expression. That will produce an error if a flag set or clear command immediately
  follows.
- Fixed: P_DamageMobj ignored MF2_NODMGTHRUST if the damaging object had no
  owner.
- Added a 'font' parameter to A_Print.
- Changed A_CustomMeleeAttack to take one damage parameter only. Since expressions
  can be used this value is not used as a factor for a random value but as
  a direct damage value instead.
- Fixed: AActor::SetState must check whether a called action function resulted
  in the actor's destruction. A_Jump constructs to a 0-length terminating
  state will hang if this isn't checked.

September 13, 2006
- Moved the vid_fps display to the upper-right of the screen.
- The stat display can now show multiple stats at once.
- Fixed: cycle_t was still a DWORD and not a QWORD under GCC.
- The stat meters now return an FString instead of sprintfing into a fixed
  output buffer.
- NOASM is now automatically defined when compiling for a non-x86 target.
- Some changes have been made to the integral types in doomtype.h:
  - For consistancy with the other integral types, byte is no longer a
    synonym for BYTE.
  - Most uses of BOOL have been change to the standard C++ bool type. Those
    that weren't were changed to INTBOOL to indicate they may contain values
    other than 0 or 1 but are still used as a boolean.
  - Compiler-provided types with explicit bit sizes are now used. In
    particular, DWORD is no longer a long so it will work with both 64-bit
    Windows and Linux.
  - Since some files need to include Windows headers, uint32 is a synonym
    for the non-Windows version of DWORD.
- Removed d_textur.h. The pic_t struct it defined was used nowhere, and that
  was all it contained.

September 9, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added support for scaled textures to DCanvas::DrawTexture.
- Changed deh.MaxHealth use to be consistent with other source ports.
- Added NULL pointer checks to APlayerPawn's state set functions. If these
  remove the player from the game a crash is the inevitable result.

September 8, 2006
- Fixed: Weapons did not give you double ammo at baby and nightmare skills.
- Fixed: SetTextureNoErr() in p_setup.cpp assumed that all color values were
  six characters. Although this was the intended way to specify colors,
  earlier versions did no error checking, so other lengths worked too.
- Fixed: FPatchTexture waited until MakeTexture() to call CalcBitSize(),
  so the width and height bit sizes weren't available when using it as a
  source for a warp texture.
- Fixed: R_InitSkyMap() should only warn about two sky textures not being
  the same height when they are used as part of a double sky.
- Added a NULL state check in AActor::Tick() before advancing the current
  state. Note that this should not happen, so there's an assert there for
  the debug build as well as a regular check for the release build.

September 1, 2006
- Version bump to 2.1.5.
- Fixed: P_LoadSegs() checked for invalid vertices too late.

August 31, 2006
- Changed: Starting a new game or reloading an old one reset the chasecam.
- Removed the r: ACS print cast. You can do it yourself with s: and an array.
- Replaced all the bool arguments to the ACS ReplaceTextures and SectorDamage
  commands with a single flags argument. SectorDamage also gained extended
  functionality: you can now make it hurt only players, only non-players, or
  both. Previously, hurting only non-players was not possible.
- Added the HUDMSG_COLORSTRING flag for ACS hudmessages. If you OR it in with
  the message type, the color will be treated as a string naming the color
  you want to use, so now you can use custom colors with hudmessages.

August 30, 2006
- Added the FNameNoInit class that is exactly like FName except it does not
  initialize its index, so it can be used from inside Actors without
  overwriting the runtime default value.
- V_BreakLines() now returns an array of FStrings instead of char *'s.
- Added support for custom text colors in messages like this:
    print (s:"\c[Chartreuce]This text is in the color 'Bleargh'");
  This also obsoletes some of the functionality of the r: print specifier
  before it even saw a release version, because you can do this with the
  standard colors too:
    print (s:"\c[Green]Some text");
- Added two new decorate functions: A_PlaySoundEx("sound_name", "channel"
  [, bLooping]) and A_StopSoundEx("channel"), where "channel" is "Auto",
  "Weapon", "Voice", "Item", "Body", "SoundSlot5", "SoundSlot6", or
  "SoundSlot7".
- Added a third parameter to S_IsActorPlayingSomething() to allow it to check
  if the actor is playing a specific sound.

August 29, 2006
- Moved the text color definitions out of the executable and into an external
  data file.
- Removed the setcolor CCMD. It's been obsolete for years, ever since color-
  aware cvars were added.
- Changed V_GetColorStringByName() to return an FString, because it did a
  copystring() call.
- Extended V_GetColorFromString() so that it accepts HTML-style #RRGGBB and
  #RGB color strings.

August 27, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- fixed: callstatechain didn't check for NULL code pointers

August 25, 2006
- Fixed: Multiple-choice sound sequences could not be assigned IDs for use
  with polyobjects and the sound sequence selector things.

August 24, 2006
- Removed the 64 seg limit for polyobjects defined with Polyobj_ExplicitLine.
- Polyobj_StartLine and Polyobj_ExplicitLine can now set a line's ID. This is
  the fourth parameter for Polyobj_StartLine and the fifth parameter for
  Polyobj_ExplicitLine.
- Added support for DDS textures compressed with DXT1, DXT3, or DXT5.

August 23, 2006
- Fixed incorrect spawn ID for cell pack.

August 22, 2006
- Added Martin Howe's code for replacing environment variables in partial IWAD
  search paths.
- Added support for casting color names in ACS print-type statements. What that
  means is that instead of writing this:
    print (s:"\cDSome text");
  You can write this:
    print (r:CR_GREEN, s:"Some text");
- Added some new colors, based on the ones jimmy91 posted in the forum: cream,
  light blue, black, olive, dark green, dark red, dark brown, purple, and dark
  gray.
- Simplified FFont::BuildTranslations() and BuildTranslations2() to make adding
  new colors easier.

August 22, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed a few redundant calls to FTexture::GetWidth because all textures
  are now fully initialized when being created.
- Added GZDoom's HI_START/HI_END namespace and HIRESTEX support.
- Added sprite scaling support to the weapon drawing code

August 21, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added support for PCX textures (1, 4, 8 and 24 bit variants.)

August 20, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed: Patch and IMGZ textures now initialize their dimensions upon creation.
  The lump is open anyway at that time so deferring this action until the information
  is needed doesn't give any speed improvements. Now GetDimensions and all its
  associated overhead is gone.
- Added support for TGA textures. It can handle all of the common variations
  of this format.
- Changed: GI_PAGESARERAW is no longer checked. It wasn't really necessary before
  because the chance of texture misidentification is absolutely minimal.
  But raw pages are now restricted to textures of type TEX_MiscPatch only.
- Changed the automap parchment to use a regular texture. The previous 
  FAutomapTexture is only used as a last resort fallback now. If the code
  finds a recognizable graphic it will create a proper texture for it now.
- Fixed: Flats were only auto-scaled when in Doom flat format.
- Fixed: FMultiPatchTexture::CheckForHacks blindly assumed that all patches
  were FPstchTextures. Since the texture code does not have any type information
  I added a new flag bIsPatch for this purpose.
- Moved all texture classes into their own source files and created a new
  subdirectory 'textures' for that.
- Cleaned up the texture management code and added some stricter checks for
  the validity of Doom patches. The old code liked to crash when being passed
  some non-graphic data.

August 19, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added custom fail messages to the puzzle items.

August 17, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a check to the map loader to check whether the map label
  is in the same WAD as the following lump.
- Did some minor reorganization of code in r_data.cpp (mostly to make
  handling of textures easier in GZDoom.)
- Did some preparations to allow loading folders on the HD into the lump
  directory.
- Took MF2_WINDTHRUST off AMorphedMonster. This is something that should not
  be a default setting.
- Moved a_artiegg.cpp to g_shared and renamed it to a_morph.cpp to better reflect
  its meaning.
- Fixed: AMorphProjectile's PlayerClass and MonsterClass members must be serialized
  as FNames. Serializing them as ints is not safe because name indices are not 
  guaranteed to be the same each time the game is started. Same for APlayerPawn's
  MorphWeapon member.
- Converted EggFX, ArtiEgg, PorkFX and ArtiPork to DECORATE. 
- Added a new parameter to A_FireCustomMissile. Previously it always aimed
  straight ahead and altered the projectile's angle according to the resulting
  direction. If the 6th parameter is 1 now it will aim at the specified angle
  directly.
- Changed custom morphing to be based on a new MorphProjectile class, not
  the Heretic specific EggFX. The EggFX properties are now prefixed with
  'MorphProjectile.'. 

August 16, 2006
- Updated thingdef_specials.h for the new thingdef_specials.gperf file.
- Created a new MorphedMonster class that Chicken and Pig now derive from.
  This class automatically takes care of unmorphing the monster when its
  time is up.
- Made PlayerClass and MonsterClass properties of EggFX. You can override
  these in a subclass to create new kinds of morpher projectiles. Along with
  that, MorphWeapon is a new property of PlayerPawn that controls what type
  of weapon you have available while morphed ("None" means you have no
  weapons).
- Changed morphed monsters to record the time when they want to unmorph, not
  the time left until they unmorph. This simplifies calling
  P_UpdateMorhpedMonster() because you don't need to pass it a tic count.
- Added an optional second parameter to A_SpawnDebris and an optional
  fifth parameter to A_SpawnItem that both do the same thing: If you set it
  to 1, then the spawned actor will be assigned the same translation table
  as the actor that called the function.
- Moved the blood colorization in P_SpawnBlood() ahead of the SetDamage()
  call so that the blood color will available to the states of the blood
  actor.
- Extended the puke command so that giving it a negative script number will
  act like ACS_ExecuteAlways and always execute the script. (Ugh. Why did I
  use's Raven's cheat code to name this command?)
- Added action special support to the thingdef expression evaluator. Now you
  can use them like normal functions, which is probably most useful for
  ACS_ExecuteWithResult.
- Switched to IJG code for reading JPEG images. I have included a stripped-
  down version of the library with the ZDoom source. (It actually uses less
  space than zlib now.) Unix users probably ought to use the system-supplied
  libjpeg instead. I modified Makefile.linux to hopefully do that. I'm sure
  Jim or someone will correct me if it doesn't actually work.

August 14, 2006
- Added JPEG texture support, courtesy of Ken's Picture Library. I will
  probably switch to the IJG library once I pare it down. (Ken's code is 18K
  of C source but does not support progressive JPEG. The IJG library is over
  a megabyte of source and supports pretty much everything you would ever
  need ever.)
- Fixed endianness issue in FTextureManager::CreateTexture().
- Added support for interlaced PNGs. Now ZDoom is a mostly complete PNG
  reader. The only thing missing is 48-bit RGB and 16-bit grayscale support,
  which are just wastes of bits here, but also less likely to appear than
  an interlaced PNG. (However, if you are using interlaced PNGs for textures,
  then you are needlessly wasting space, since the image won't display
  progressively.)
- Fixed: Writing named screenshots didn't work.

August 12, 2006
- Added support for truecolor PNG textures. They still get resampled to the
  global palette, but at least they are visible now.
- Optimized UnfilterRow() in m_png.cpp a little.

August 11, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: P_CheckOnMobjZ returned the first thing an actor could stand on, 
  not the highest possible.
- Added disintegration damage to SectorDamage.
- Bumped savegame version, min. savegame version, netgame version and
  demo version because the inventory and damage changes are incompatible
  with the old code.

August 11, 2006
- Added the ACS commands
  ReplaceTextures (str old_texture, str new_texture, optional bool not_lower,
      optional bool not_mid, optional bool not_upper, optional bool not_floor,
      optional bool not_ceiling); and
  SectorDamage (int tag, int amount, str type, bool players_only, bool in_air,
      str protection_item, bool subclasses_okay);
- Added the vid_nowidescreen cvar to disable widescreen aspect ratio
  correction. When this is enabled, the only display ratio available is 4:3
  (and 5:4 if vid_tft is set).
- Added support for setting an actor's damage property to an expression
  through decorate. Just enclose it within parentheses, and the expression
  will be evaluated exactly as-is without the normal Doom damage calculation.
  So if you want something that does exactly 6 damage, use a "Damage (6)"
  property. To deal normal Doom missile damage, you can use
  "Damage (random(1,8)*6)" instead of "Damage 6".
- Moved InvFirst and InvSel into APlayerPawn so that they can be consistantly
  maintained by ObtainInventory.

August 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Gave Strife's PhosphorousFire the MF2_NODMGTHRUST flag so that its
  damage is truly thrustless. The 'thrustless' parameter disabled all
  thrust done by PIT_RadiusDamage but not the one done by P_DamageMobj.
  Also gave Hexen's poison cloud the MF3_BLOODLESSIMPACT flag and made
  spawning of blood decals in PIT_RadiusAttack depend on that. Since with
  these changes the 'bombthrustless' argument to P_RadiusAttack is no 
  longer useful I removed it.
- Fixed: CheckActorInventory stored the return value in the wrong address
  on the ACS stack.
- Fixed: Skin sounds weren't properly restored after a SNDINFO reset.

August 6, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a more flexible ACS ChangeLevel function. It gets passed a level name
  instead of a level number and has several additional options (e.g. changing
  skill, starting the map without monsters and clearing the players' inventories.
- Changed Thing_Activate so that passing a tid of 0 activates the calling actor.
- Changed Thing_Remove so that passing a tid of 0 removes the calling actor.
- Added DECORATE parameters to A_Saw.

August 2, 2006
- Fixed: The ACS VM made no checks for object files without strings, assuming
  that if it didn't have any strings, then it didn't matter what it calculated
  for the location of the string table because it would never be referenced.
  While this is true for a script all by itself, it means a crash if you have
  a map script without strings that imports a library with strings and the
  library tries to use one of its strings.

August 1, 2006
- It turns out that the Visual C++ 2005 runtime calls IsDebuggerPresent, which
  is not available under Windows 95. Since this is (or at least should be) the
  only thing preventing us from running under Windows 95, I added a stub that
  replaces __imp__IsDebuggerPresent@0 with a pointer to a function that checks
  for the real thing.

August 1, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The pickup message for Hexen's fighter's axe was assigned to the
  AxePuff, not the weapon itself.
- Fixed: P_RunEffects used the consoleplayer's camera without checking its
  validity.
- Fixed: CopyFriendliness needs to copy target to LastHeard as well in order
  to make newly spawned monsters chase their spawner's target.

July 31, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a type check to Spawn(actorname,...) to allow it to print a 
  meaningful message instead of the nondescript 
  'Tried to spawn a class-less actor'.
- Converted AGlassJunk to DECORATE and made the spawn function a little
  more flexible so that replacing the shard is easier.
- Converted ABloodSplatter to DECORATE.
- Removed A_Jiggle because it never worked properly.
- Changed DECORATE parser to allow commas between arguments for multi-
  argument properties. For all newly added properties this format will
  become mandatory but for backwards compatibility it is optional for
  old ones.
- Added a check for negative indices to TAutoGrowArray::SetVal to prevent
  passing an index of -1 from crashing the game.
- Fixed: Morphing must clear the weapon's flash sprite.
- Fixed: Resurrecting a morphed player caused a crash.
- Fixed: Random sounds that recursively refer to themselves caused a stack
  overflow. Now they print a warning and get ignored.

July 30, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Grubber's GetPlayerInfo ACS function.
- Fixed: Starting a game without skill menu always started the first episode.
- Changed A_AlertMonsters so that it can be placed directly in a weapon state.

July 29, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Frozen corpses of stealth monsters were invisible.
- Added: Calling Radius_Quake with a tid of 0 now uses the activator
  as the quake's center.
- Used the new explosion handling to clean up the old style projectile 
  definitions. The SimpleProjectile class is gone and it uses the meta
  data and A_ExplodeParms instead now.
- Removed the deprecation warnings for explosion parameters again because 
  the new system is fully inheritable and therefore useful again.
- Changed the explosion properties into meta data and adjusted A_ExplodeParams
  to use these when called without any parameters. Also removed all special
  parsing for A_Explode so now this function can be called with expressions
  like any other function.
- Changed DECORATE parsing so that functions with completely optional 
  parameter lists don't create an empty list when called without parameters.

July 28, 2006
- Version bump to 2.1.4.
- Fixed: Friendlies would not turn to face you when you engaged them in
  conversation, nor would they reliably return to their original facing when
  you stopped talking to them.
- Added deprecation warnings for the DontHurtShooter, ExplosionRadius, and
  ExplosionDamage actor "properties." They were considered deprecated before;
  now this is explicitly stated when they are used. The problem with them is
  that they are not really properties and do not behave like other properties
  and cannot be inherited, because they are really just an alternate way of
  specifying parameters for A_Explode. (Anything that currently prints a
  deprecation warning will be removed completely in 2.2.0, which will be the
  version where custom state labels make their debut.)

July 26, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed player sprite translation for the menu so that it uses a regular
  translation table instead of a local custom buffer.
- Fixed: ResetBaggage must set MeleeDamage to 0.

July 21, 2006
- Made SafeReadMemory() in i_crash.cpp more readable.
- Here's something MinGW users will probably like: i_crash.cpp no longer needs
  dbghelp.h if you compile with GCC.

July 19, 2006
- Added some simple translucency map analysis for BOOM maps to more
  intelligently pick the value to use for TranslucentLine's second argument.
- Added a queryiwad_key cvar to control which key can force the IWAD selection
  to appear. It can be either "shift" or "control". Any other value will
  disable its functionality.
- Fixed: A_SkullPop() and A_FreezeDeathChunks() did not transfer the player's
  inventory to the new dismembered head "player".

July 18, 2006
- Fixed: C_midPrint() needs a NULL status bar check.

July 17, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PClass::CreateDerivedClass forgot to NULL FActorInfo::Replacee.

July 16, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: S_ClearSoundData cleared PlayerClasses instead of PlayerClassLookups.
- Added NecroMage's submission for bitwise/shift assignment operators for ACS.
- Added replacement handling to A_BossDeath.
- Fixed: The check for no skill menu was incorrect when a custom player
  class menu was present so instead of starting the game specific skill menu
  it always started Hexen's.
- Fixed: When a non-player tried to play a player sound it tried to access 
  the actor object as an APlayerPawn.
- Changed PlayAttacking2 to always use the melee state instead of different
  implementations per player and hard coding it to MissileState+1. Also
  changed PlayAttacking for the HereticPlayer to use the same animation as
  PlayAttacking2. Now the special handling for Heretic in the FireWeapon
  functions can be removed.
- Fixed: PlayerStartItem created a duplicate of the item's class name before
  converting it into an FName.
- Removed game check for Doom from P_BloodSplatter. The BloodSplatter actor
  is compatible with all games now so the explicit handling is no longer needed.
- Moved replacement handling back into AActor::StaticSpawn but controlled
  by a (mandatory) parameter. Also added replacement to most other
  instances in the game where non-inventory items are spawned. Replacement is safe 
  nearly everywhere except for inventory related spawns.
- Fixed: Due to the player class inclusion A_NoBlocking never called
  NoBlockingSet for monsters.
- Changed: Sounds can be specified by full path now in SNDINFO and S_SKIN.

July 15, 2006
- Fixed: Makefile.mgw was mysteriously missing some targets. After fixing that,
  I also removed some of GCC's warnings.

July 14, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Any kill in multiplayer games that could not be credited to a player
  didn't count at all - not even toward the global level statistics.
- ...and removed it again. It was not an accident. The only reason the PowerupGiver
  had its own RespawnTics was to account for the pickup flash delay. 
  But that is better handled by checking the flag and adding the additional 30 
  tics in AInventory::Hide because then it affects all items that have one - 
  and only those. The AT_GAME_SET function didn't work anyway because it was
  called after parsing DECORATE.

July 13, 2006
- Restored the PowerupGiver AT_GAME_SET function. I assume its removal was an
  accident from merging in Grubber's custom player classes.

July 13, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed the game filter check from addplayerclass. If a player class is added
  here the game filter is irrelevant and there's nothing that should prevent
  the HereticPlayer being added to a Hexen game, for example.
- Changed: The addplayerclass CCMD was far too paranoid and needlessly aborted
  the game for any error being encountered. Since an empty player class list
  is checked for elsewhere outputting the messages to the console is sufficient.
- Generalized Hexen's class-based spawning to be a property of the player class
  so now it is available in all games.
- Replaced the call to A_FlameSnd in the HereticPlayer's burn death sequence
  with A_FireScream and defined *burndeath for Heretic.
- Added Grubber's custom player class support.

July 12, 2006
- Changed decorate replacement to be opt-in instead of opt-out. This allows for
  greater flexibility in what can be replaced (replaced actors need not be ancestors
  of actors that replace them) at the expense of not having universal actor
  replacement. Instances where replacements work:
   - Line specials that spawn things (Thing_Spawn and related)
   - ACS spawning commands (SpawnSpot and the like)
   - Spawning mapthings at level load time in P_SpawnMapThing()
   - Spawning items off of dead dudes in P_DropItem()
   - The A_SpawnItem decorate function
   - The summon and summonfriend console commands
   - ThingCount will count both original actors and their replacements as the same
     things.
  TBD: Should the ACS inventory functions use replacements too, or not?
- Fixed: The game would crash after informing you of a duplicate class registration
  because PClass::CreateDerivedClass() did not initialize everything before calling
  InsertIntoHash().
- Fixed: Forcefully removing a weapon from a player's inventory would not reset
  the player's refire counter.
- Fixed: FreeKeySections() was called before M_SaveDefaults() during shutdown,
  so all custom keys would go to a "(null)" section instead of their intended
  section.

July 11, 2006
- Restored the previous level flag values to avoid needlessly breaking some
  savegames at this point in time.
- Fixed: R_ClearPlanes() did not clear skybox planes for a full clear.
- Streamlined zip file loading by delaying the processing of the local file
  header until it is actually needed.

July 11, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed the additive scrollers option into a compatibility flag so that it can
  be changed from the menu.

July 10, 2006
- Fixed closed doors between the front sector's floor and ceiling the right way.
  I was just missing a non-null texture check.
- Removed references to texturewidthmask. What was that?

July 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The earthquake code needs to check whether a quake's spot is still valid.
  Super Sonic Doom crashed due to this.
- Fixed: G_DoAutosave could divide by 0 if autosavecount was 0.

July 9, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The calls to DCanvas::Dim in c_console.cpp were missing some type casts.
- Fixed: CCMD(dir) passes FStrings directly to Printf.
- Fixed: The defaultbind command still treated the bindings as char pointers and
  as a result didn't work.
- Added SpawnSpotFacing ACS function which is the same as SpawnSpot but it uses
  the map spot's angle.
- Added ThingCountName ACS function which is the same as ThingCount but it takes
  an actor's type name instead of a spawn ID.

July 9, 2006
- Fixed: If the sector behind a seg was closed, but it was closed between the
  ceiling and floor of the front sector, the renderer did not add it to the
  solid clip list.

July 8, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Specifying 'strifefallingdamage' in MAPINFO cleared all other flags.
- Fixed: maxstepheight and maxdropoffheight were stored as ints instead of 
  fixed_t's by the DECORATE parser.

July 7, 2006
- Blends created with the ACS fade commands now degrade to transparent overlays
  when the console is visible, just as they do for the menu.
- Added actor replacement for DECORATE. This works at a higher level than
  using duplicate DoomEdNums and will affect all attempts to spawn the
  replaced actor. However, because this happens for all spawns and not just
  at map load, the replacing actor must be compatible with the replaced
  actor, which means that an actor can only serve as a replacement for one
  of its baseclasses. For example, if you want to use a modified imp, you can
  use this DECORATE:
      actor MyImp : DoomImp replaces DoompImp
      {
          // Put changed properties here
      }
- New: The IWAD dialog now remembers the last IWAD you picked and
  automatically highlights it the next time you run the game. This also
  applies if you check "Don't ask me this again": The IWAD selected will be
  the one that gets automatically loaded, not the one located first. (Using
  the -iwad parameter will not change the default IWAD.) In addition, you
  can now bring the dialog up even if you disable it by holding down SHIFT
  during startup.
- Changed ExtractFilePath() and ExtractFileBase() to return FStrings instead
  of writing to a provided output buffer. ExtractFileBase() can also
  optionally keep the file's extension in the result.
- Removed the -heapsize parameter entirely. The informational message should
  no longer be needed.
- Removed -maxdemo parameter. There's no point to having it around since
  the demo buffer grows automatically.

July 3, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Changed initialization of Weapon.Kickback so that it is only done
  for direct descendants of AWeapon and not for every weapon being defined.
- Changed parsing of actor names back to not use C-mode. This change breaks
  any definition that contains periods in their name and apparently there's
  more than anyone could expect. Also altered the parser to manually check
  for colons inside the parsed string so that placing spaces around them
  is no longer necessary.
- Fixed: Weapons could be picked up for ammo even if they gave none.
- Fixed: A_Beacon was missing a NULL pointer check for the beacon's owner.
- Fixed: The status bar tried to access CPlayer->camera without checking
  its validity. In spy mode there is a possibility that it is NULL.

July 2, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: G_NewInit destroyed the players' userinfo data.
- Changed the special radius damage handling for the barrel and boss brain
  into an actor flag.
- Added A_RadiusThrust code pointer for DECORATE and adjusted the radius 
  attack functions accordingly.

July 1, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: In multiplayer games, when trying to change targets, A_Chase forgot
  to check whether the new target was the same as the old one and treated 
  this case as a real target change.

June 30, 2006
- Changed the earthquake view shaking so that it works for anything and not
  just players.

June 29, 2006
- Added some hackery at the start of MouseRead_Win32() that prevents it from
  yanking the mouse around if they keys haven't been read yet to combat the
  same situation that causes the keyboard to return DIERR_NOTACQUIRED in
  KeyRead(): The window is sort of in focus and sort of not. User.dll
  considers it to be focused and it's drawn as such, but another focused
  window is on top of it, and DirectInput doesn't see it as focused.
- Fixed: KeyRead() should handle DIERR_NOTACQUIRED errors the same way it
  handles DIERR_INPUTLOST errors. This can happen if our window had the
  focus stolen away from it before we tried to acquire the keyboard in
  DI_Init2(). Strangely, MouseRead_DI() already did this.
- When a stack overflow occurs, report.txt now only includes the first and
  last 16KB of the stack to make it more manageable.
- Limited StreamEditBinary() to the first 64KB of the file to keep it from
  taking too long on large dumps.
- And now I know why gathering crash information in the same process that
  crashed can be bad: Stack overflows. You get one spare page to play with
  when the stack overflows. MiniDumpWriteDump() needs more than that and
  causes an access violation when it runs out of leftover stack, silently
  terminating the application. Windows XP x64 offers SetThreadStackGuarantee()
  to increase this, but that isn't available on anything older, including
  32-bit XP. To get around this, a new thread is created to write the mini
  dump when the stack overflows.
- Changed A_Burnination() to be closer to Strife's.
- Fixed: When playing back demos, DoAddBot() can be called without an
  associated call to SpawnBot(). So if the bot can't spawn, botnum can
  go negative, which will cause problems later in DCajunMaster::Main()
  when it sees that wanted_botnum (0) is higher than botnum (-1).
- Fixed: Stopping demo recording in multiplayer games should not abruptly
  drop the recorder out of the game without notifying the other players.
  In fact, there's no reason why it should drop them out of multiplayer at
  all.
- Fixed: Earthquakes were unreliable in multiplayer games because
  P_PredictPlayer() did not preserve the player's xviewshift.
- Fixed: PlayerIsGone() needs to stop any scripts that belong to the player
  who left, in addition to executing disconnect scripts.
- Fixed: APlayerPawn::AddInventory() should also check for a NULL player->mo
  in case the player left but somebody still has a reference to their actor.
- Fixed: DDrawFB::PaintToWindow() should simulate proper unlocking behavior
  and set Buffer to NULL.
- Improved feedback for network game initialization with the console ticker.
- Moved i_net.cpp and i_net.h out of sdl/ and win32/ and into the main source
  directory. They are identical, so keeping two copies of them is bad.
- Fixed: (At least with Creative's driver's,) EAX settings are global and not
  per-application. So if you play a multiplayer ZDoom game on one computer
  (or even another EAX-using application), ZDoom needs to restore the
  environment when it regains focus.
- Maybe fixed: (See http://forum.zdoom.org/potato.php?t=10689) Apparently,
  PacketGet can receive ECONNRESET from nodes that aren't in the game. It
  should be safe to just ignore these packets.
- Fixed: PlayerIsGone() should set the gone player's camera to NULL in case
  the player who left was player 0. This is because if a remaining player
  receives a "recoverable" error, they will become player 0. Once that happens,
  they game will try to update sounds through their camera and crash in
  FMODSoundRenderer::UpdateListener() because the zones array is now NULL.
  G_NewInit() should also clear all the player structures.

June 29, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a 'default' setting to all color selection menu items that leaves 
  the font untranslated.
- Fixed: Heretic's monsters were missing the MF2_MCROSS flag.

June 28, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Bouncing projectiles should not bounce off horizon lines. Now they
  vanish instead.
- Changed masses of ice chunks and glass shards to make small splashes
- Fixed: P_UndoPlayerMorph didn't properly transfer the inventory. It just 
  copied the pointer instead of using ObtainInventory.

June 24, 2006
- Moved the version resource into the "compile-time directives" section of
  the resource script so that Developer Studio won't replace the version macros
  in it with their literal values. Now updating version.h is guaranteed to be
  enough to bump the version everywhere it's used.

June 24, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PIT_CheckThing checked AActor::tid instead of TidToHate to determine
  whether a monster of the same species can be hurt.
- Added new ice chunk sprites submitted by Enjay.
- Replaced all occurences of 'ZDoom' in i_crash.cpp with a define from version.h 
  so that this file doesn't need to be changed for altering the texts.
- Deleted the programmer death script from strifehelp.acs because it is no 
  longer used.
- Fixed: strfhelp.acs and the PUMPUPS cheat need to give 10 UpgradeStaminas
  because that item is using Inventory::Amount now.

June 23, 2006
- Changed the archive format for crash reports from tar.gz to zip.
- Went back to a single process model for crash reporting. It appears there
  are some machines that don't like having another process collect the
  information and report it. I still feel that having another process do
  it _should_ be more reliable, because that process can execute in a known
  good state. Ah well. I haven't yet seen anything that left the main process
  in a totally unrecoverable state, so it's probably okay. Unlike before, this
  single-process version is still GCC-compatible.

June 23, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The resurrect cheat didn't reset the player's damage type so
  if he died by being frozen the blue blend didn't disappear.
- Fixed: FWarpTexture::MakeTexture must be declared virtual so that
  the FWarp2Texture version of it can be called.

June 22, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The check to prevent items from being given to dead players
  didn't work properly. It has to be done in the cheat code, not in
  APlayerPawn::AddInventory.
- Fixed: The medikit and stimpack used a MaxAmount of 100 so that
  stamina upgrades were ineffective.
- Fixed: Jumping and crouching at the same time created jerky results.
  Now jumping takes precedence and you can't crouch while pressing the
  jump key (which causes an uncrouch.)

June 21, 2006
- Fixed: DF_NO_COOP_WEAPON_SPAWN was handled backwardly.
- Fixed: G_InitLevelLocals() needs to OR in the crouching bits, otherwise it
  discards the jumping bits.
- ProcessActor() now sets C mode before retrieving the actor's name.
- Fixed: The new SC_GetString() scanner accepted slashes at the end of tokens
  when not in C mode, even if they were the start of a comment. Now if you
  want a slash at the end, you must quote it.

June 21, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Decal actors with an invalid decal texture caused a crash.
- Fixed: Player could crouch while dead.
- Fixed: The sidedef loader could allocate insufficient memory if a map
  contained unused sidedefs.
- Fixed: Color control sequences were written to the log file. Since any
  entered console command contains such a sequence it was quite noticable.
- Fixed: The obituary code didn't use the attacker's name for kills caused
  by other players.
- Fixed: PIT_StompThing never checked for COMPATF_NO_PASSMOBJ.
- Fixed: COMPATF_TRACE returned true for all two-sided lines, not just for
  those with the same sector on both sides.

June 20, 2006
- Added grubber's thingdef_exp.cpp. I might not use it later, but I can still
  use it now.
- Unlimited the monster pain sounds in Hexen after I played as the Cleric a
  while and killed several centaurs with the flechette.
- Fixed: Moving to an old level in a hub caused the old player's inventory to
  spawn owned by the current player (but still hanging off the old player), so
  the game would hang when trying to delete it.
- Modified re2c so that it doesn't add a date to the file it generates. Thus,
  if it regenerates a file during a full rebuild, SVN won't see it as a change.
  Also updated it to 0.10.5.
- Fixed: SC_GetString() did not properly terminate sc_String when the last
  token in the file had no white space after it. Since I could not actually
  find the problem (it works fine in debug mode and I saw no logic errors),
  I decided to take this opportunity to reimplement it using an re2c-generated
  scanner. Now it's 1.6x faster than before and correctness is easier to
  verify.

June 19, 2006
- Fixed: FMODSoundRenderer::Shutdown() also needs to reset NumChannels.
- Added back the Manifest to zdoom.rc for non-VC8 Windows compilers.
- Fixed MinGW compilation again. Now it uses the same method as Makefile.linux
  to find all the source files so that it doesn't need to be manually updated
  each time source files are added or removed.
- Added the SVN revision number to the version string. A new tool is used to
  obtain this information from the svnversion command and write it into a
  header file. If you don't have the svn command line tools installed or didn't
  check it out from the repository, you can still build. I added some rules for
  this to Makefile.linux, and I assume they work because they do for
  Makefile.mingw.
- Fixed: MIDISong2 did not delete MusHeader in its destructor.

June 19, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed the unused sfx_ variables for the chainsaw sounds.
- Fixed map name checks in idclev, hxvisit, for +map and the titlemap.
- Changed handling of Zips so that the patches/, graphics/, sounds/ and
  music/ subdirectories no longer are placed in the global namespace. Instead
  new namespaces are defined. These namespaces aren't merged, however and 
  searching in them either returns a lump inside it or one from the global
  namespace when it doesn't come from a Zip file. Proper order of files is
  still observed though. As a result proper use of the directories inside Zips 
  is strictly enforced now so that for example anything used as a patch must be 
  in the patches/ directory and won't be found anywhere else.

June 18, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added another set of ACS inventory functions which take a tid for the actor
  and aren't limited to the script's activator.
- Added GetSectorLightLevel(tag), GetActorCeilingZ(tid) and
  SetActorPosition(tid, x, y, z, fog) ACS functions.
- Fixed: First initialization of camera textures should not mark the rendered
  lines as mapped.
  
June 17, 2006
- Finally implemented code to keep some or all of your inventory intact when
  respawning in coop. Now the new inventory code should finally be complete. :-)
- Fixed: PROP_Inventory_PickupMessage was improperly defined for non-VC++
  compilation.

June 17, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted a_doomhealth.cpp to DECORATE.
- Added a PickupMessage property to the internal actor parser, replaced
  most of the virtual PickupMessages with it and placed the code that
  reads the metadata into AInventory::PickupMessage. Now the
  PickupMessage method is truly virtual and I can do:
   Added a Health.LowMessage property to define double message items like
   Doom's medikit in DECORATE.
- Since defining Mana3 as an ammo type and then overriding the TryPickup
  method means that this item defeats all ammo checks in the game it might
  as well be defined as a CustomInventory item. At least this fixes the
  amount given in easy and very hard skills.
- Converted all ammo items to DECORATE.
- Changed internal property setting of ammo types and sister weapons
  to use fuglyname as for DECORATE definitions. This allows to export
  the ammo definitions into DECORATE definitions without doing it for
  the weapons themselves.
- Replaced obituary methods with actor properties.
- Fixed: The secret map check didn't work for maps inside Zips.

June 14, 2006
- Fixed loading of Build/Blood maps.
- FWadLump::Read() now handles Blood decryption directly.
- Fixed: A fatal error thrown during map loading after the sectors have been
  counted but before they are allocated crashed in PointerSubstitution().
- Removed my "backwards compatibility fix" for APROP_Speed. It turns out that
  in all the public versions where monster speed is not fixed point, you
  couldn't modify the monster's speed due to a bug in P_Move() anyway. So
  there's nothing to be backward compatible with.

June 14, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Saving on maps that don't contain a MAPINFO definition didn't work.
- Fixed: The Zip loader loaded all WADs inside a Zip into the lump directory.
  This is only supposed to be done for WADs in the root directory.

June 12-14, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Complete restructuring of the map loading code. Previously the only way
  to put maps into Zips was to load them as embedded WADs which caused
  some problems, most importantly that the map's file name was irrelevant
  and the internal map label was used instead. With the new code there
  is now a properly defined way to add maps to Zips:
  * Maps are placed in a subdirectory called 'maps'.
  * Maps are stored as WADs that contain all map related lumps.
  * The first lump in the map's WAD directory must be the map label.
  * All lumps not belonging to the first map are ignored.
  * The map's file name determines the name the map is identified with. 
    For maps stored this way the internal map label is ignored so with this 
    method renaming maps is as easy as renaming a file and it is no longer 
    necessary to manipulate the map label.
  With the new code it is also possible to load external maps without
  adding them to the WAD list. Type 'open mapfile.wad' in the console
  to start such a map.
  The new code also performs stricter lump name checks to prevent accidental
  loading of non-map data.

June 13, 2006
- Moved level scroller information out of G_InitLevelLocals() and into
  P_FreeLevelData() so that it also gets performed at shutdown.
- Fixed: In the past, ZDoom worked like Doom and used integral values for
  monster speeds. Now it uses fixed point so that an actor's speed property
  can always be considered is always fixed point. So DoSetActorProperty()
  should scale very slow speeds, just like dehacked's PatchThing() has done
  for some time now.

June 11, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed UpgradeStamina to use AInventory's Amount and MaxAmount to
  control the amount of upgrade and the maximum that can be reached.

June 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The skin loader assumed that all skin textures are in Doom patch
  format. Now it calls FTexture::CreateTexture to do proper checks.
- Removed the PickupSound method from FakeInventory and changed it so that
  it uses AInventory::PickupSound to store its custom pickup sound.
- Removed the PickupMessage method from FakeInventory. This can be handled
  by the standard pickup message code now that it uses the meta data for the
  message.
- Fixed: The maximum indices for StrifeTypes were inconsistent. Now the
  allowed range is 0-1000 in all situations.
- Fixed: Setting a local SNDINFO for a map deleted all skin based sounds.
- Added a crouchsprite property to the skin info.
- Fixed: Crouching sprites must be checked each frame, not just each tic.
- Added an srand call to D_DoomMain in order to randomize the values returned
  by rand which is being used to shuffle the playlist.

June 10, 2006
- Fixed: Information added with addkeysection and addmenukey was never freed.
- Fixed: A classic decorate FakeInventory's PickupText was never freed.
- Fixed: Colored lights were never freed.
- Fixed: When a dehacked patch was applied, the dehacked StateMap was never
  freed.
- Removed termdone checks around atterm(S_ClearSoundData) and
  atterm(S_Shutdown) because atterm() already checks for duplicates.
- Fixed: S_ClearSoundData() should unload all sounds before it clears S_sfx.
- Fixed: AltSoundRenderer::LoadSound() didn't check if the sound had already
  been loaded and lost the old sound data if it had been.
- Fixed: FinishDehPatch() needlessly duplicated the new DehackedPickup's name.
- Fixed: PatchStrings() allocated a private string and never freed it.

June 8, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed music name handling in MAPINFO so that music can be specified by
  full path of a file in a Zip.
- Fixed: intermusic in MAPINFO was limited to WAD lumps and couldn't handle 
  external data.

June 8, 2006
- Fixed: Trying to play a 0-length song from a wad inside a zip caused a crash.

June 7, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: A_CustomPunch didn't use the range parameter correctly.

June 6, 2006
- Integrated recent ZDBSP improvements into the internal nodebuilder:
 - ClassifyLine now chooses either SSE2 or regular x87 math depending on whether
   or not SSE2 is available at runtime. Since most of the time is spent in
   ClassifyLine, using SSE2 in just this one function helps the most.
 - Nodebuilding is a little faster if we inline PointOnSide.
 - Changed FEventTree into a regular binary tree, since there just aren't enough
   nodes inserted into it to make a red-black tree worthwhile.
 - Added more checks at the start of ClassifyLine so that it has a better chance
   of avoiding the more complicated checking, and it seems to have paid off with
   a reasonably modest performance boost.
 - Added a "vertex map" for ZDBSP's vertex selection. (Think BLOCKMAP for
   vertices instead of lines.) On large maps, this can result in a very
   significant speed up. (In one particular map, ZDBSP had previously
   spent 40% of its time just scanning through all the vertices in the
   map. Now the time it spends finding vertices is immeasurable.) On small maps,
   this won't make much of a difference, because the number of vertices to search
   was so small to begin with.

June 3, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a StartConversation special that allows automatic activation of Strife
  dialogs.
- Added Thing_Raise special that allows Arch-Vile like resurrections from scripts
  or DECORATE states.
- Added a RadiusDamageFactor property for actors. This replaces the hard coded
  factor of 0.25 for Hexen's players.
- Added new SpawnProjectile function to ACS. It's the same as Thing_Projectile2
  but the projectile is specified by name, not spawn ID.
- Added MAPINFO option to set the compatibility flags. If this is done these
  explicit settings will take precedence over the compatflags CVAR.

May 31, 2006
- Merged in recent ZDBSP fixes:
 - Added code to explicitly handle outputting overlapping segs when
   building GL nodes with ZDBSP, removing the check that discarded
   them early on.
 - AddIntersection() should convert to doubles before subtracting the vertex
   from the node, not after, to avoid integer overflow. (See cah.wad, MAP12
   and MAP13.) A simpler dot product will also suffice for distance calculation.
 - Splitters that come too close to a vertex should be avoided. (See cata.wad.)
 - Red-Black Tree implementation was broken and colored every node red.
 - Moved most of the code for outputting degenerate GL subsectors into another
   function.

May 31, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Ammo items dropped by monsters that have a default amount of 1 didn't
  contain any ammo at all. 
- Fixed: PClass::FreeIndices was declared as TArray<size_t> in the header but
  as TArray<unsigned int> in the cpp file.

May 28, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PowerFrighteners must check Owner for NULL in InitEffect and EndEffect.

May 28, 2006
- Fixed: When building GL nodes for Deathkings MAP42, one polyobject had one
  of its segs thrown away, so the map could not start. This was because the
  nodebuilder assumed all subsectors would be 2D and could not handle the
  case where a degenerate 1D subsector is created. In this case, that happens
  because that map has three polyobjects in the middle of the void, so the only
  way to assign them to a subsector is to use a 1D subsector.

May 28, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Monsters couldn't hurt other monsters of the same species if they
  were supposed to hate them.
- Since I was editing the file anyway I added checks for Heretic's and Strife's
  damaging floor types to DCajunMaster::IsDangerous.
- Added a NULL pointer check to DCajunMaster::TurnToAng because a crash log
  indicated that this can happen.
- Fixed: Strife's energy pod contains 20 units when dropped by monsters.
  To achieve this I added an Ammo.DropAmount property because there are
  no other means to control this from inside a conversation script.

May 27, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: FString::FormatHelper must not alter the null string.
- Fixed: FString::FormatHelper should use ReallocBuffer instead of directly
  calling Realloc. This caused crashes with the ACS print function.
- Fixed: The dummy player spawned in G_FinishTravel must not start any ENTER
  scripts.

May 26, 2006
- Changed makewad's zip routines so that it simply stores files that cannot be
  compressed smaller instead of using deflate anyway. Saves 133 bytes currently.

May 26, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: CallStateChain relied on CallingState being preserved across the
  call of the state's action function. This is not the case when a missile
  is being spawned and exploded right away.
  
May 25, 2006
- Fixed: The C code in AltSoundRenderer::CopyAndClip() did not shift the sample
  data enough (2 bits instead of 8), so it was super loud and aliased.
- Fixes for GCC 4.1: Several type-punned pointer warnings, but more
  importantly, declaring a friend function inside a class body is no longer
  enough to declare that function globally; you must declare it again outside
  the class.
- Upgraded FArchive::SerializePointer so that it can store 32-bit indices.
- ACS printing pcodes now build their string in an FSttring instead of a fixed
  sized buffer on the stack.

May 24, 2006
- Modified ccdv-win32 to show "Generating X" messages when running lemon and
  re2c instead of "Linking X".
- Updated lemon and re2c to the latest versions and ported dehsupp to use them
  for code generation. (Xlatcc is next.)
- Added function level linking for Makefile.mingw.
- Disabled RTTI generation and enabled function-level linking in the VC 2005
  zdoom project.
- Fixed: TAG_MORE now uses __va_copy to copy the taglist when building with
  GCC, so that should let it build under x86-64 and any other GCC targets.

May 24, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: A_SpawnItem performed an integer multiplication with fixed point
  values to calculate the spawn position.
- Fixed: A_SpawnItem tried to set the spawned actor's angle before checking
  the validity of the returned pointer.

May 23, 2006
- Added missing linker dependencies for Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and
  fixed building of the assembly files when the source is located in a path
  with spaces.

May 22, 2006
- Fixed: The new sound pausing on menu open interrupted Strife conversations.
- Did some very preliminary support for x64 compiling.
- Now I see why makewad is using the __fastcall calling convention by default:
  Because the release zlib is built with it as well.
- Fixed: Conversion from 'const char *' to 'char *' in DEM_SAVEGAME case in
  Net_DoCommand().
- Updated the project files for Visual C++ 2005.
- Fixed: The new Thing_ChangeTID check would infinite loop if an actor
  scheduled for destruction was encountered.

May 22, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Thing_ChangeTid must check whether the actor whose tid is about to
  be changed is scheduled for destruction.
- Fixed: G_FinishTravel added the player to the hash chain twice.
- Fixed: The animations for Doom's E3 intermission used incorrect patch names.
- Added a check for MF_NOLIFTDROP to PIT_CeilingRaise because the overlapping 
  bridges in 007LTSD got moved by this function.

May 21, 2006
- Fixed GCC 4 warnings in FNodeBuilder::CreateSubsectorsForReal().
- Changed f_finale.cpp/atkstates[] into a static variable, since its
  anonymous type prevents it from being accessed from other files anyway.
- Fixed: The behavior of the eventtail advancement in d_net.cpp/CheckAbort()
  was compiler-dependant.
- Fixed warnings GCC 4 threw up while compiling re2c and lemon.
- Removed __cdecl from makewad.c again. This is already defined as a builtin
  for MinGW, and redefining it produces a warning. (Why is main explicitly
  declared __cdecl anyway?)
- Fixed building ccdv-win32 with GCC 4. GCC 4 creates a memcpy call, which
  won't work because it doesn't get linked with the standard C library.

May 20, 2006
- Fixed default.cbd and Makefile.mingw for current code state.
- New: Pausing the game (through any means, not just the pause key) now pauses
  sound effects as well as music. "PauseMusicInMenus" has been added as a
  MAPINFO flag to also pause the music when a menu or the console are open.

May 20, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The automap code had the check for rotation reversed.
- Changed type PClass::FreeIndices to TArray<unsigned int> because that's
  the type of the indices.
- Fixed: makewad.c needs __cdecl for non-Windows builds.
- Fixed: FinishThingdef didn't check whether the WeaponClass pointer in
  AWeaponPiece was a valid name.

May 19, 2006
- Fixed: FloorAndCeiling_Raise/Lower did not work with slopes because they
  used ZatPointDist instead of PointToDist to calculate the destination
  distance for the plane equation.
- Fixed: Sky scroll positions could "jump" once they wrapped past position
  32767. An fmod now keeps them within range of the sky textures' real widths.

May 19, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Increased the StrifeTypes array to 999 entries so that custom WADs have 
  more flexibility when defining dialogs.

May 18, 2006
- Added a check against rw_havelow in the "sky hack" part of R_NewWall().
  This prevents the front ceiling from being moved up if there has been no
  texture defined to draw on the wall. This makes various parts of The
  Darkest Hour render properly again while still allowing the crosses in
  heroes2.wad and lamasery.wad to render correctly.
- Added a NULL sector check to P_CheckFakeFloorTrigger() because there was
  a crash report indicating that an actor being pushed up by a moving floor
  had a NULL sector. Since this field should be valid for every actor, the
  debug build gets an assert here, and the release build just returns without
  doing anything.
- Fixed: Camera textures were not rendered properly when the underlying
  canvas's pitch and width were different (which, really, only happens if
  you use ridiculously large camera textures).
- Fixed: FCanvasTextureInfo's were never freed.
- Fixed: MAPINFO special action structures were not freed.
- Fixed: FSingleLumpFont::LoadFON2() never freed its widths2 array.

May 17, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: In case the path to strife1.wad didn't contain any '/' an
  incorrect path was created for voices.wad.
- Fixed: The code building the path for Strife's voices.wad called the
  wrong FString constructor.
- Fixed: LS_Thing_SetGoal set MF5_CHASEGOAL in flags, not flags5.

May 17, 2006
- Fixed: M_NotifyNewSave() needlessly created a copy of the filename.
- Fixed: Any touching_sectorlists for actors unlinked in G_StartTravel() were
  lost forever.
- Fixed: DLightningThinker::Serialize() did not delete the old
  LightningLightLevels array when loading from an archive.
- Fixed: Although I moved the correct polyobject freeing code into
  P_FreeLevelData(), I left the old wrong code there too, which just deleted
  the array without deleting anything hanging off of it.
- Texture animation improvements:
  * Animations are now millisecond-accurate, so delays in ANIMDEFS can have
    fractional parts.
  * Cleaned up the animation code and moved it into r_anim.cpp.
  * Blood's oscillating texture animations are now available for use by actual
    supported games by adding the word "oscillate" after a "range" definition
    in ANIMDEFS.
  * Not exactly texture animation, but it's handled in the same function as
    texture animations: Scrolling skies also have millisecond precision.

May 16, 2006
- Implemented Quasar's suggestion to use line flag 2048 as a "reserved" flag
  that, if set, clears all the non-original-Doom flags on a line. This is
  only for Doom format maps when playing Doom.
- Added support for automatically loading ACS objects (even for Doom-format
  maps). To use it, compile the ACS files as ordinary libraries placed
  between A_START/A_END markers. Then outside the markers, create a lump
  called LOADACS. This is just a plain text lump that lists all the libraries
  you want to autoload with every map. You can do this with as many libraries
  as you want, and LOADACS lumps are also cummulative.
- Fixed: ApplyActorDefault() must ensure that dataint is non-negative before
  calculating a non-NULL state. When compiling with Visual C++, states are
  stored in the defaults list as byte values, but when compiling with GCC,
  they are passed as 32-bit arguments to the function directly. So in VC++,
  using ~0 to specify a NULL state appears as 255, but in GCC, it appears as
  -1.

May 16, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a missing NULL pointer check to APlayerPawn::Tick.
- Fixed: The falling scream should not be played when the player is under
  water.

May 15, 2006
- Fixed: CopyPlayer() in p_saveg.cpp should use normal assignment, not
  memcpy to copy the player structures.
- Fixed compilation with MinGW again and removed most of the new warnings.
- Changed the memory management for FString. Instead of using a garbage
  collected heap, it now uses normal heap calls and reference counting to
  implement lazy copying. You may now use bitwise operators to move
  (but not copy!) FStrings around in memory. This means that the
  CopyForTArray template function is gone, since TArrays can now freely
  move their contents around without bothering with their specifics.
  
  There is one important caveat, however. It is not acceptable to blindly 0
  an FString's contents. This necessitated the creation of a proper
  constructor for player_t so that it can be reset without using memset. I
  did a quick scan of all memsets in the source and didn't see anything else
  with a similar problem, but it's possible I missed something.
- Fixed: Build tiles were never deallocated.
- Fixed: Using Build's palette.dat only got half the palette right.

May 14, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a show_obituaries option to disable obituaries without disabling
  other more important message types which have lower priority for some
  reason.
- Added a menu option for show_messages after accidentally switching it
  off far too often and wondering why no messages appear.
- Added crouching DoomPlayer sprites submitted by Enjay.
- Fixed DF_NO_CROUCH was not checked.
- Fixed: The intermission script parser had some of its cases in the
  keyword parser incorrectly sorted.
- Fixed: atterm was still defined to take a STACK_ARGS function argument.
- Added an AltFlash state for weapons.
- Turned FloatSpeed into an actor property and changed the value to 5
  for all floating Strife actors, as a comment in the source indicated.
- Added GZDoom's code for Vavoom slope things because I wanted to test
  something with a map from Silent Steel.
- Added nocrouch and allowcrouch MAPINFO commands and a DF_NO_CROUCH
  dmflag.
- Added GZDoom's crouching code after cleaning it up so that adding
  crouching sprites will be easier.

May 13, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: P_StartScript was missing a NULL pointer check for the error
  message. When trying to puke a script outside a map it crashed.
- Fixed: The random number generator for large numbers must mask out the
  sign bit before performing a modulo.
- Now that the conversation states are pointers there is no need to make
  AActor::ConversationAnimation virtual. No class overrides this method 
  anymore.
- Replaced AMacil1::TakeSpecialDamage with MF5_NODAMAGE.
- Fixed: AMacil2::TakeSpecialDamage and AOracle::TakeSpecialDamage didn't
  check whether inflictor was NULL and crashed when used with 'kill monsters'.
- Fixed: Some Strife decorations didn't loop their animation
- Changed: The decision whether blood splatter sprites are spawned is no
  longer determined by game. Instead there's a new flag, MF5_BLOODSPLATTER
  which is deciding what to do. To keep backwards compatibility this flag
  is unset for projectiles in Doom and Strife and set for them in Heretic 
  and Hexen. The same applies to DECORATE but of course the flag can be
  manipulated here.
- BLODxx sprites are now globally renamed to BLUDxx when not playing Doom. 
  This allows using the same states in every game, including the 
  Raven-specific blood actors.
- Gave the bullet puff and the axe blood masses of 5 so that the make small
  splashes.
- Added A_Light(value) code pointer for DECORATE to generalize the weapon
  light effect.
- Added 'noskillmenu' option to MAPINFO episode definitions. This is for
  WADs that want to implement a skill selection level.
- Added APROP_ChaseGoal and APROP_Frightened actor properties for ACS.
- Added MF5_CHASEGOAL flag that makes monsters to go after their goal even
  if they have a valid target.
- Fixed some issues with the changes to P_NewChaseDir I made to include
  MBF's dropoff logic.
- Added a PowerFrightener powerup class. It seemed like such a waste to
  have this cool feature but no means to use it in a decent fashion.
- Fixed: S_Init and S_ParseSndInfo should call atterm only once but not
  each time they are called.

May 11, 2006
- Merged a lot of these static destructor-only structs into regular
  functions added to the exit chain with atterm so that they can be called
  in a deterministic order and not whatever order the linker decides to put
  them in.
- Fixed: DCajunMaster did not free its getspawned.
- Fixed: P_FreeLevelData() did not free ACS scripts.
- Fixed: Level snapshots were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: The save/load menu list was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: FCompressedMemFile needs a destructor to free the m_ImplodedBuffer.
- Fixed: G_DoLoadGame() did not free the engine string.
- Fixed: M_ReadSaveStrings() did not free the engine string.
- Fixed: Processing DEM_SAVEGAME did not free the pathname string.
- Added a check for truncated flats to FFlatTexture::MakeTexture() because
  Heretic's F_SKY1 is only four bytes long.
- Added a dump of the offending state to the "Cannot find state..." diagnostic.
- Fixed: FCompressedFile did not initialize m_Mode in its default constructor.
- Fixed: Heretic and Hexen status bars did not initialize ArtiRefresh.
- Fixed: PNGHandle destructor should use delete[] to free TextChunks.

May 11, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted the stealth monsters to DECORATE.
- Added string replacement option to obituary strings.
- Changed lock and pickup message handling so that it is either a real
  string or a LANGUAGE identifier. The only reason I did the mixed format
  in the first place were Hexen's lock messages but they have been 
  replaced by unique strings in the mean time so the feature isn't needed 
  any more.
- Added a flags parameter to TranslucentLine.
- Extended the second arg of Line_SetIdentification to set not only 
  ML_ZONEBOUNDARY but all 8 bits of the third byte in the flag word.
  This allows a relatively simple means of setting all the new flags
  directly.
- Moved ML_ZONEBOUNDARY to doomdata.h so that it is in the same place as the
  other line flags.
- Fixed: Strife's teleport swirl didn't loop its animation.
- Fixed: Strife's rat is not supposed to be shootable.
- Fixed: Strife's MiniMissile pickup amount was still incorrect.
- Moved Strife's random dialogs into the string table. Now it should also be
  possible to define dialogs for other actors as well.

May 10, 2006
- Fixed: When revisiting a map in a hub, the player could spawn at the wrong
  height if the floor had moved while they were there before. This was because
  the player was spawned on the original copy of the map before the changes to
  it were dearchived, so they didn't know about the new floor height.
- Fixed: Calling BaseFileSearch() and letting it fill in the file's extension
  didn't work because the space for the path was deallocated before it
  returned.
- Guess we're not leak-free yet. Try travelling around in a hub and see that
  it leaks. I don't have time to track it down right now.
- Yay! We now seem to be free of memory leaks! The next step will be to
  merge a lot of these static destructor-only structs into regular
  functions added to the exit chain with atterm so that they can be called
  in a deterministic order and not whatever order the linker decides to put
  them in. (Interestingly, the amount of memory used when repeatedly
  executing the same map command at the console varies up and down, but it
  now stays relatively stable rather than increasing unbounded.)
- Fixed: The list of resolutions in the video modes menu was not freed
  at exit.
- Fixed: mus_playing.name was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: SN_StopAllSequences() should be called at the start of
  P_FreeLevelData(), not just before the call to P_SetupLevel() in
  G_DoLoadLevel(), so it can run even at exit. And C_FullConsole() can
  call P_FreeLevelData() to free more memory too.
- Fixed: StatusBar was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: spritesorter was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Bad things happened if FString's data pool was destroyed before
  all C_RemoveTabCommand() calls were made.
- Added an overload for FArchive << FString.
- Fixed: The players' log text was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Bot information was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: doomcom was not freed at exit. But since it's always created,
  there's no reason why it needs to be allocated from the heap. My guess
  is that in the DOS days, the external packet driver was responsible for
  allocating doomcom and passed its location with the -net parameter.
- Fixed: FBlockNodes were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Openings were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Drawsegs were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Vissprites were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Console command history was not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Visplanes were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: Call P_FreeLevelData() at exit.
- Fixed: Channel, SoundCurve, and PlayList in s_sound.cpp were not freed at
  exit.
- Fixed: Sound sequences were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: DSeqNode::Serialize() did not resize the m_SequenceChoices array
  when loading.
- Fixed mvlineasm1 and mvlineasm4 so that they can be used with textures
  taller than 256 pixels. There was a very slight performance hit for this,
  but I was able to tweak mvlineasm4 to make it approximately as fast as
  before. Interestingly, maskwallscan manages to be nearly as fast as
  wallscan despite having to check every pixel for transparency. I'm
  tempted to dump all the old masked rendering code and use
  (trans)maskwallscan for everything for the sake of simplicity: Only
  two functions to maintain for each render style, and much less
  complicated supporting code. Currently, I need five different functions
  for each rendering style: One traditional column-at-a-time style like
  Doom did it originally, two for rt_draw4cols, and two for transmaskwallscan.
  (Right now, I have cheated, and just done the ones that can be used
  by walls for transmaskwallscan, so the actual number of different functions
  isn't quite so high.) For small textures, such as font characters and
  far-away sprites, I'm sure maskwallscan is faster than the current code.
  For large textures, it's probably still competitive even if it isn't faster.
  But considering how similar wallscan and maskwallscan perform, the
  difference is probably pretty minimal, and maskwallscan still might come
  out ahead due to its simpler overhead.

May 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: PClass::CreateNew didn't check whether the class had valid
  defaults and tried to copy data from a NULL pointer.
- Fixed: FireThing and BrassTorch were misspelled in hexendecorations.txt
- Changed A_ChangeFlag so that it doesn't need to alter the flag 
  string. With strings being passed as names this is unsafe.
- Removed unused parameter types from the function parameter parser for
  DECORATE.
- Changed: All actor name parameters in DECORATE are now passed as 
  FNames, not as strings. 
- Fixed: The MAPINFO parser stored the RedirectType as a type pointer.
  But at this point DECORATE hasn't been read yet so this was limited to
  the internal classes.
- Fixed: TXT_NEED_IDCARD wasn't terminated with a ';'.
- Fixed: Strife's DeadRebel was missing its DoomEdNum.
- With names as type identifiers it is no longer necessary to remap
  the monster types to internal constants in A_BossDeath.
- Fixed: A_BossDeath got the string from a name - just to get a name from
  the string. Using the name directly is sufficient.

May 9, 2006
- Redid ClearLcoks() fix that I accidentally removed.
- Added a new setting for am_rotate: 2 will enable rotation only for the
  overlay map while leaving the regular map unrotated.
- Added a new setting for am_overlay: 2 will disable the normal automap and
  show only the overlayed version.
- Fixed?: WallSpriteColumn apparently needs to set dc_texturefrac. At least
  Valgrind seems to say so.
- Fixed: The FWadCollection destructor needs to use free to free the LumpInfo
  and Wads arrays.
- Fixed: The ColorMapKiller needs to use the delete[] form of delete.
- Fixed: FConfigFile::ClearCurrentSection() should be calling the delete[] form
  of delete to free the entry.
- Fixed: FPatchTexture::MakeTexture() does not need to blindly recreate the
  Spans if they already exist.
- Fixed: The FMultiPatchTexture destructor did not call its Unload() method.
- Restored the original padding calculation to FMultiPatchTexture::MakeTexture().
  I believe the Valgrind errors were caused by accessing off the end of the
  screen buffer, not from accessing off the end of a texture.
- Backported the classnames-are-names changes from the FP code.
- Backported the improved hierarchical dumpclasses command from the FP code.
- Updated Jim's Makefile.linux.
- Added support for wrapping midtextures vertically.
- Since zdoom.wad is now zdoom.pk3, the default mapinfos can use full pathnames.
  So now they do.
- Fixed: The DSimpleCanvas constructor used a pitch too narrow on screens wider
  than 640 pixels when using a non-AMD processor and the processor's L1 cache
  line size could not be determined. I think this should fix the issue of
  weirdly rendered 8 pixel wide borders on the left and right of the screen that
  some people experienced.
- Fixed: The secnodes were never freed.

May 9, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed a few Strife ammo amount values.
- Fixed the ClearLocks function so it doesn't crash when called before the
  ActorInfos have been created.
- Fixed: The FSpecialFont constructor created the name string twice.
- Fixed: The animated door parser was still leaking memory when it encountered
  an invalid animation due to missing textures.
- Fixed: The music volume list wasn't freed.
- Fixed: The image for WADs that were loaded from inside Zips was never freed.
- Changed FDoorAnimation deletion so that the array takes care of it. The
  original destructor approach would have necessitated a lot more supporting
  code to work as intended.
- Fixed: Skin definitions were never freed.
- Fixed: Names in terrain definitions were never freed. Replacing them with
  FNames would have been a good idea anyway.
- Fixed: The lock definitions were never freed.
- Fixed: FDoorAnimation was missing a destructor.
- Fixed: animation and switch definitions were never freed.
- Replaced all other places where FindType was used with FNames with 
  IFindType.
- Fixed: If you want to use a name as the missile parameter for the basic
  attack functions the type search in DoAttack must be case insensitive.
- Fixed: APowerup::DoEffect must do more thorough checks before resetting
  the fixed colormap.

May 8, 2006
- Fixed: The names in the Depths array in m_options.cpp were never freed.
- Fixed: FDoomEdMap needed a destructor.
- Fixed: Decal animators were never freed.
- Fixed: Colormaps were never freed.
- Fixed: Memory allocated in R_InitTranslationTables() was never freed.
- Fixed: R_InitParticles() allocated way more memory than it needed to. (And the
  particle memory was never freed, either.)
- Fixed: FMetaTable::FreeMeta() should use delete[] to free string metadata.
- Fixed: FConfigFile::ClearCurrentSection() must cast the entry to a char *
  before deleting it, because that's the way it was allocated.
- Fixed definitions of DeadZombieMan and DeadShotgunGuy in doom/deadthings.txt.
  Skip_super resets the dropitem list, so having it after "DropItem None" is
  pointless.
- Fixed: Decorate DropItem information was never freed.
- Fixed: FinishStates() allocated even 0-entry state arrays.
- Fixed: Default actor instances were never freed.
- Fixed: FRandomSoundList never freed its sound list.
- Fixed: Level and cluster strings read from MAPINFO were never freed.
- Fixed: Episode names were never freed.
- Fixed: InverseColormap and GoldColormap were never freed. Since they're always
  allocated, they can just be arrays rather than pointers.
- Fixed: FFont destructor never freed any of the character data or the font's name.
- Fixed: Fonts were not freed at exit.
- Fixed: FStringTable::LoadLanguage() did not call SC_Close().
- Fixed: When using the -iwad parameter, IdentifyVersion() did not release the
  buffer it created to hold the parameter's path.
- Blends created with the ACS fade commands now degrade to transparent overlays
  when the menu is visible, so they can no longer obscure the menu.

May 7, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a misc/secret sound definition for Heretic.
- Fixed: Powered up weapons were not properly deselected when the level ended
  and their ready state was different from the main weapon's.
- Made some improvements to A_CountdownArg.
- Removed the 'Yes', 'No' and 'Greetings' state assignment commands. They haven't
  been documented and thus haven't been used at all so far. Therefore they don't 
  need to be handled considering that they will go away anyway.
- Changed the DECORATE state parser so that Stop can also be specified right after
  a label, in addition to goto.

May 6, 2006
- The game is now free of leaks up to the point just after the wads are loaded.
- Fixed: Although TypeInfos are now deleted at exit, their FlatPointers or ActorInfo
  data was not freed. I chose not to use a destructor to handle this, because then it
  would no longer be a POD type that can be statically initialized.
- Fixed: Aliases were not deleted at exit.
- Fixed: FWadCollection did not free its hash tables, lump info, full names, or the
  list of open files when destroyed.
- Updated Italian strings that someone kindly e-mailed to me.
- The CRT no longer detects any memory leaks when I run to the IWAD picker and quit.
- Fixed: The memory used to hold the path to zdoom.wad/.pk3 was not freed if
  the IWAD picker was cancelled.
- Fixed: Some implementations of cvar->GetGenericRep (CVAR_String) returned a 
  statically allocated string and others returned a dynamically allocated string.
  To be consistant, they should all be static.
- Fixed: DObject also has three static TArrays that should not be explicitly
  initialized: Objects, FreeIndices, and ToDestroy.
- Added a new do-nothing constructor for TArray that can be used for BSS objects
  that are manipulated before startup. Specifically, this was added because
  C_AddTabCommand() is called before main, but the TabCommands constructor is
  called after the array already has over 100 entries in it, orphaning everything
  that was already inserted. And since the code is much nicer-looking now, I didn't
  want to revert to the old non-TArray version.
  
  This could also have been used to fix FName, but I consider the current
  implementation to be better than the old one, so I'm leaving it as-is.

May 6, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted a_zombie.cpp and most of a_strifestuff.cpp to DECORATE.
- Converted a_strifekeys.cpp to DECORATE and moved the pickup messages to the
  string table.
- Removed the WIF_HITS_GHOSTS weapon flag and replaced it with MF2_THRUGHOST. 
  There is no need to keep two flags around with virtually the same meaning.
- Changed the ShadowArmor to use the VISIBILITYPULSE flag to change its translucency.
  It looks much better now than the cheap code pointer based blinking it used before.
- Converted most of a_strifeitems.cpp to DECORATE and moved the pickup messages 
  to the string table.
- Converted a_strifearmor.cpp to DECORATE and moved the pickup messages to the
  string table.
- Moved the messages for killing spectres to the string table.
- Converted the quest items to DECORATE. Also changed A_GiveQuestItem to get
  the messages it prints from the string table instead of the quest item's tag
  string.

May 5, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed the hopelessly outdated thingdef_doc.txt file from the repository.
- Converted a_peasant.cpp and a_ratbuddy.cpp to DECORATE.
- Fixed: C_DoKey didn't treat an empty string as 'no binding' when checking for
  valid double bindings.
- Converted a_merchants.cpp to DECORATE.
- Added MF5_NODAMAGE flag to generalize the behavior of Strife's merchants which
  can be shot but take no damage from getting hurt.
- Converted a_beggars.cpp to DECORATE.
- Added an Inventory.GiveQuest property. This makes it possible to define all of
  Strife's original items that also give a quest item in DECORATE but it is also 
  useful to define items like the ones in Day of the Acolyte without ugly workarounds.
- Added a Tag property and Strife teaser conversation IDs to DECORATE so now it is 
  possible to define many of Strife's items.
- Added a FastSpeed property to DECORATE so that projectiles can finally be
  assigned a higher speed for fast mode.
- Added a ACS_LockedExecuteDoor special. It is basically the same as the existing
  ACS_LockedExecute but it uses the 'door' message instead of 'remote'. This
  cannot be integrated into ACS_LockedExecute because all its arguments are already
  in use.
- Added a fully customizable A_CustomMeleeAttack function for DECORATE.

May 5, 2006
- Fixed: Scanned IWAD paths were not freed if you exited without selecting one.
- Fixed: Dynamically allocated cvars were not freed on exit.
- Fixed: FConfigFile's destructor did not free space used for Values.
- Added "DropItem None" as a way for inherited actors to avoid dropping items if
  their superclass normally does. This is only needed if somebody dehacks
  DeadZombieMan or DeadShotgunGuy.
- Moved Doom's dead body actors into DECORATE so that I can finish and verify the
  implementation of "States { StateLabel: goto SomeOtherLabel }" constructs. The
  alternate method of overriding inherited states is now deprecated, since it's
  incompatible with the coming custom state labels.
- Changed TAG_MORE to pass a va_list pointer instead of a va_list because it's a
  non-POD type when targeting several non-ix86 targets with GCC. Hopefully this works.
  (Guess it didn't. Boohoo.)

May 4, 2006
- Rewrote FName to use only POD types for its static data so that it can be used
  without any explicit constructors being called.
- Fixed: ZTwinedTorchUnlit, ZWallTorchUnlit, ZFireBullUnlit, and ZCauldronUnlit
  were missing game filters.

May 4, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added Poisondamage property for DECORATE. I first did this for one of the first
  DECORATE updates but the code seems to have gotten lost.
- Converted A_Puzzleitems.cpp and parts of A_HexenSpecialdecs.cpp to DECORATE.
- Converted A_Hexendecorations.cpp to DECORATE.
- Changed the lower decal spawning code to transfer the main decal's color if
  the lower decal's default color is the same as the main decal's.
- Changed the decal stretcher back to use the specified size parameters as a 
  scaling factor and not a destination size because this is more consistent with 
  the rest of the decal code. Also adjusted the blood smear definition in DECALDEF
  and the description in the Wiki for this.
- Added Jim's most recent fixes.

May 3, 2006
- Fixed: Conversion of c_bind.cpp to FString was incomplete.
- Fixed some functions that were declared as taking size_t's but defined as taking
  unsigned ints.
- Added a dummy object to delete sound environments on exit.
- Fixed: FWarpTexture did not delete its Spans when destroyed.
- Changed wadclusterinfos and wadlevelinfos arrays into TArrays.
- Added the TypeInfo::AutoTypeInfoPtr for TypeInfo::m_RuntimeActors so they can
  be automatically deleted.
- Changed TypeInfo::m_Types into a TArray so it will be automatically deleted
  on exit.
- Fixed: TArray::Resize() did not deconstruct entries when shrinking the array.
- Changed TArray::Push() so that it calls Grow() instead of duplicating the growth
  calculations itself.
- Calling TArray::Grow() for a small amount when the array is short should grow it
  a bit more than it was doing.
- Removed generational garbage collection from the string pool because it didn't
  actually work.
- Turned the list of TabCommands into a TArray because I saw lots of console
  commands in the memory leak report at exit. Then I realized those were actually
  key bindings, so I changed the Bindings and DoubleBindings arrays into FString
  arrays.
- Fixed: FStringCVar was missing a destructor.
- Added TArray::Insert().
- Fixed: TArray::Delete() used memmove().
- Renamed Malloc(), Realloc(), and Calloc() to M_Malloc(), M_Realloc(), and
  M_Calloc() so that the debug versions can be defined as macros.
- Enabled the CRT's memory leak detection in WinMain().
- Moved contents of PO_DeInit() into P_FreeLevelData().
- Removed "PolyBlockMap = NULL;" from P_SetupLevel(), because the P_FreeLevelData()
  call it makes next does the exact same thing, but also freeing it if needed.
- Fixed: Unneeded memcpy in UnpackUserCmd() when ucmd and basis are the same
- Removed -bpal parameter. Blood's blood.pal is loaded from blood.rff, and
  its tiles are loaded from the same directory.
- RFF files now load their entire directories into the lumplist.
- Added char * and const char * type coversions for FString, so FStrings can be
  freely passed to functions expecting C strings. (Except varargs functions,
  which still require manually fetching the C string out of it.)
- Renamed the name class to FName.
- Renamed the string class to FString to emphasize that it is not std::string.

May 3, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Converted A_Speedboots.cpp, A_HexenArmor.cpp and A_Hexenkeys.cpp to DECORATE
- Fixed a few memory allocation issues pointed out by Jim's Valgrind dump.
- Removed doom.x, heretic.x and strife.x from the SVN repository. These
  are generated files.
- Fixed: A_PainDie has to check whether a valid target exists before 
  calling IsFriend.
- Fixed: FDecalLib::FindAnimator needs a signed counter to work properly.

May 1, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added support for game specific pickup messages, if only to be able
  to define Raven's invulnerability item in DECORATE.
- Removed A_TreeDeath because it is no longer used.
- Fixed: When picking up a PowerupGiver for an active powerup the
  blend color and the duration were transferred to a temorary item
  and never took effect. They have to be trnasferred to the newly created
  powerup item before trying to give it to the player, not afterward.
- Made the colormap of the InvulnerabilitySphere item specific. 
  The base power class still needs to have its color adjusted
  per game though and since Raven's invulnerability item is used in both
  Hexen and Heretic it can't define its own colormap/blend.
- Separated the invulnerability colormaps from the game being played
  and made them item specific. They can also be specified as regular
  blend colors in DECORATE now.
- Converted a_hereticarmor.cpp and most of a_doomartifacts.cpp,
  a_hereticartifacts.cpp and a_heretickeys.cpp to DECORATE.
- Changed the Soulsphere to be a real health item with the Dehacked
  modifications made in d_dehacked.cpp as for most other items which
  need to be adjusted.
- Added IF_BIGPOWERUP flag to AInventory to expose the RESPAWN_SUPER
  dmflag to DECORATE. Also removed the now obsolete ShouldRespawn methods
  from AInvulnerabilitySphere and ABlurSphere.
- Converted a_splashes.cpp to DECORATE.
- Converted most of a_debris.cpp to DECORATE.

May 1, 2006
- Made loading of Build's palette.dat automatic if it's found inside a loaded
  group file, but the -bpal parameter remains for now.
- Made loading of Build art tiles automatic if they are found inside a group
  file. Removed the corresponding command-line parameter.
- Added support for Ken Silverman's group files.

April 30, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed the DCorpseQueue class. It was no longer used and since
  the savegames it might have been used in have become incompatible
  a long time ago there is no reason to keep it around anymore.
- Fixed: level.maptime must be set to 0 every time a level is loaded.
- Converted a_doomarmor.cpp and a_doomkeys.cpp to DECORATE.
- Replaced all need key messages that weren't already in LANGUAGE with
  a LANGUAGE identifier. Also made the messages for Hexen's keys unique
  strings instead of constructing them at run time.
- Added: Pickup messages can now handle embedded localized strings - like
  the need key messages
- Converted a_hereticdecorations.cpp as well.
- Time to put the capabilities of Zip files to good use:
  Converted a_doomdecorations.cpp into a DECORATE lump to test my changes.
  (The EXE got 24 kb shorter by that - much more than I expected...)
- Added a 'game' property to DECORATE so that game specific IDs can be
  defined.
- Added an #include directive to the DECORATE parser.
- Also removed ABreakableDecoration. Using AActor and the metadata
  for the death and burn height gives the same results with less code.
- Removed the ADecoration class. It just inherited from AActor without
  adding any functionality of its own.
- Added functions to sc_man to save and restore the full script state.
  This allows recursive use of the script parser.
- Changed SC_Open to check for full names in a ZIP first.
- Fixed: Ammo2 no longer gets displayed when it is identical to Ammo1.
- Re-enabled the death camera due to public demand but made it switchable
  by a CVAR.

April 29, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- ZDoom now loads zdoom.pk3 instead of zdoom.wad.
- Fixed: StreamSong::SetVolume should check the m_stream pointer. This can
  happen when a TimiditySong doesn't use FMOD and outputs the sound itself.
- Fixed: 'use' sector actions were using the incorrect sector on several 
  occasions.
- Added a wi_noautostartmap CVAR and a noautostartmap intermission option
  that force the user to manually end the 'entering level' page.

April 23, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Added a clipmidtextures level flag which exposes the ML_CLIP_MIDTEX
  feature globally per level. Also moved the setting of this flag for Strife
  into MAPINFO.
- Added MBF's logic to move monsters away from a dropoff but changed it
  so that it doesn't require a general change in the movement code.
- Added: The Trace function needs a compatibility option to exclude
  two-sided lines with both sides in the same sector from being checked.
  Originally this wasn't done and some WADs (e.g. Alien Vendetta MAP15)
  need the original behavior to work.

April 22, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Removed ABossEye::Serialize because it didn't do anything.
- Fixed the issues with .96x's railgun code and added it to the current
  version.
- Fixed: Setting of the friendly Minotaur's angle was inconsistent and
  could cause it to move backwards in a f�w situation.
- Fixed: The minotaur did checks for type by checking for the MF_FRIENDLY
  flag, not by checking for the actor class. That made it impossible to
  spawn friendly 'normal' minotaurs.
- Moved a few virtual methods which are only applicable to the friendly
  minotaur to AMinotaurFriend.
- Fixed: The friendly minotaur checked the master's health instead of
  the target's when deciding whether to switch targets. Replaced with
  MF4_NOTARGETSWITCH.
- Fixed: maybedrawnow must not draw the console unless the background
  texture has been set up.
- Fixed: V_InitCustomFonts initialized lastlump to -1 instead of 0.
- Fixed: CreateTexture never checked whether it could read from the
  texture lump. Since the minimum valid length is 13 bytes for a
  1x1 pixel patch everything below that will now return with an error.
- Fixed a few occurences of mismatched free's for new'd memory.

April 21, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: To prevent the pointer cleanup code from crashing numsectors has
  to be set to 0 when the sectors array is deleted.
- Added Zloba's fix for Linux's I_FindFirst.

April 20, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Doom's status bar assumed that STBAR was always in Doom patch format.
- Added MF3_DONTSPLASH to the newly created sound sequence things.
- Fixed: makewad.c used C++ syntax.
- Fixed: Strife's ending check included destroying the computer - an event
  that happens before the branch in the story.
- Fixed: The overloaded FRandom::Random2 function with mask parameter didn't
  use its parameter.
- Added Jim's latest makefile.linux

April 20, 2006
- Fixed: Crash when opening the player setup menu when you're so dead that
  your head has popped off your body.
- Fixed: When item respawning is on and you play on skill 1 or 5, picking
  up ammo would permanently double the amount of ammo received from that
  item the next time it gets picked up.
- Added a check to PlayerIsGone() for players who have already had their
  actors destroyed before calling it.
- Fixed: G_CheckDemoStatus() only restored your name, autoaim, and color
  settings after playing back a demo.
- Added DEM_SPRAY net command so that sprayed decals work in multiplayer
  and demos.
- Changed DEM_GIVECHEAT to use a word for specifying the item quantity.
  This is useful mainly for giving yourself more than 255 health at a time.
- Fixed: DEM_SUMMONFRIEND was not handled by Net_SkipCommand().
- Fixed compilation with mingw again.
- Added multiple-choice sound sequences. These overcome one of the major
  deficiences of the Hexen-inherited SNDSEQ system while still being Hexen
  compatible: Custom door sounds can now use different opening and closing
  sequences, for both normal and blazing speeds.
- Moved the TArray serializer into farchive.h so that tarray.h doesn't need
  farchive.h at all because GCC was much pickier than VC. Because of this,
  I don't need the FArchive change I made yesterday that hid FArchive's
  TArray uses behind pointers.
- Added a countof macro to doomtype.h. See the1's blog to find out why
  it's implemented the way it is.
    <http://blogs.msdn.com/the1/articles/210011.aspx>
- Added a new method to FRandom for getting random numbers larger than 255,
  which lets me:
- Fixed: SNDSEQ delayrand commands could delay for no more than 255 tics.
- Fixed: If you're going to have sector_t.SoundTarget, then they need to
  be included in the pointer cleanup scans.

April 19, 2006
- Added a serializer for TArray. This required I make a couple changes to
  FArchive in order to avoid circular references between farchive.h and
  tarray.h.
- Ported back newer name code from 2.1.
- Fixed: Using -warp with only one parameter in Doom and Heretic to
  select a map on episode 1 no longer worked.
- New: Loading a multiplayer save now restores the players based on
  their names rather than on their connection order. Using connection
  order was sensible when -net was the only way to start a network game,
  but with -host/-join, it's not so nice. Also, if there aren't enough
  players in the save, then the extra players will be spawned normally,
  so you can continue a saved game with more players than you started it
  with.
- Added some new SNDSEQ commands to make it possible to define Heretic's
  ambient sounds in SNDSEQ: volumerel, volumerand, slot, randomsequence,
  delayonce, and restart. With these, it is basically possible to obsolete
  all of the $ambient SNDINFO commands.
- Fixed: Sound sequences would only execute one command each time they were
  ticked.
- Fixed: No bounds checking was done on the volume sound sequences played at.
- Fixed: The tic parameter to playloop was useless and caused it to
  act like a redundant playrepeat. I have removed all the logic that
  caused playloop to play repeating sounds, and now it acts like an
  infinite sequence of play/delay commands until the sequence is
  stopped.
- Fixed: Sound sequences were ticked every frame, not every tic, so all
  the delay commands were timed incorrectly and varied depending on your
  framerate. Since this is useful for restarting looping sounds that got
  cut off, I have not changed this. Instead, the delay commands now
  record the tic when execution should resume, not the number of tics
  left to delay.

April 19, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Hexen's ammo display in the status bar cannot be refreshed 
  partially because the background patch has to be drawn always to 
  overwrite the old display.
- Fixed: Giving a health item to a non-player caused a crash.
- Added a compatibility option to limit deh.MaxHealth to the health bonus.
  Originally this value wasn't used for health packs. Doing this was a bug
  in Boom but since there's quite a few maps out there which require
  Boom's altered behavior it has to be compatibility optioned.
- Fixed: The health bonus's max health must be defined by deh.MaxHealth, 
  not deh.MaxSoulsphere. To achieve this deh.MaxHealth's handling had to
  be altered because it has to default to 100.
- Fixed: ZDBSP created incorrect side references with compressed sidedefs
  and both sidedefs of a linedef being the same. This only affects the
  external tool because the internal node builder is run after uncompressing
  the sidedefs.
- Added Jim's latest makefile.linux.
- Added a consistency check to the PNAMES loader because one crash log
  indicated that it crashed due to a corrupt PNAMES lump.
- Brought back the sector based sound target handling as a compatibility
  option. This radical change just broke far too many maps that depend
  on the original behavior. Strife's special AI functions are excluded 
  though because they work better with the new method.
- Fixed: Hexen had no default sound sequence for doors and passed a NULL
  pointer to SN_StartSequence in DoorSound.

April 18, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed A_CHolyAttack used linetarget to set the spirits' target actor.
  But it assumed that this variable was still valid from shooting the
  weapon. Not only is that not guaranteed. When used by the ClericBoss
  it is an unwanted effect because the linetarget is most likely the 
  last thing the player fired at which normally is the ClericBoss itself. 
  A_CHolyAttack now sets tracer to the intended target instead of 
  relying on linetarget being preserved.
- Fixed: Strife's grenades only bounce twice off the floor. They also
  bounce off all actors and immediately explode when hitting liquids.
- Fixed: Strife's flame thrower gives 100 ammo as a pickup item but only
  40 when given in a dialog.
- Moved the sky change script starts for the Programmer into MAPINFO as
  special death actions.
- Changed the sky in MAP09 of Strife to the blue sky to make it more
  consistent. Now the sky change occurs when the player wakes up after
  fighting the programmer.

April 18, 2006
- Fixed: DBaseStatusBar::DrBNumber() should behave like Doom's
  STlib_drawNum(), and FDoomStatusBarTexture::DrawToBar() should add
  the textures left offset to the x coordinate before drawing.
  These fix Twice Risen's status bar.
- Changed: VPrintf now uses string.VFormat(), instead of vsprintf().

April 17, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Oracle Pass is an item, not a key. Strictly speaking the
  same applies to the Prison pass but having that as a key masks
  some bad design in Strife so it is better to leave it a key.
- Fixed: The spectral lightning spot used a weird combination of flags
  that made it act quite unexpectedly. After removing all flags except
  MF_NOBLOCKMAP it seems to do what it is supposed to do. I also had
  to add a new flag, MF5_NODROPOFF to prevent the spot from moving over
  tall ledges.
- Fixed: When giving an autoactivatable item to the player a copy is
  created to allow respawning. But when the item had been successully
  used the original was destroyed, not the copy.
- Fixed: dssiglup was misspelled as dssglup in SNDINFO so the Sigil's
  charging sound never played.
- Fixed: The sigil doesn't use the generic weapon pickup sound. It should
  use weapons/sigilcharge.
- Fixed: P_Move never checked whether a monster has the MF2_PUSHWALL flag.
  As a result everything using A_Chase was able to activate pushable
  walls and not just the monsters which are allowed to activate them.
- Fixed: P_Move must split the move if the step size is larger than the
  radius.
- Fixed: tmfloorpic was set in P_LineOpening. But this is not guaranteed
  to set the correct picture because the end result depends on the line
  ordering and not the sector heights. It must be set in PIT_CheckLine.
- Fixed: Due to the previously missing ceilingsector variable bouncing
  missiles could use the incorrect sector when hitting an edge between
  ceilings of different height.
- Fixed: Missiles exploding on the edge of a ceiling neighboring to a
  sky vanished instead of exploding if the missile's center was in the
  sky sector. To do this I added ceilingsector and ceilingpic variables 
  to AActor, similar to the already existing floorsector and floorpic.
- Fixed: ZDoom now looks for ZDoom.wad in the program directory first.

April 16, 2006
- Fixed: After respawning in a singleplayer demo, demo playback went out
  of sync becase the RNG seed was being altered during recording but not
  during playback. This was caused by an inappropriate fix for a similar
  problem: -record calls G_InitNew() before it actually starts recording
  the demo, but -playdemo calls G_InitNew() after it starts playback. So
  the rngseed stored in the demo was already altered. The correct thing
  to do is not to prevent the rngseed from changing during playback but
  to move the call to G_InitNew() after the call to G_BeginRecording().
- Fixed: After respawning in a demo, demo playback was prematurely
  terminated.

April 16, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Increased the limit for the sound DoorCloseLight in Hexen to 4 because
  it got cut off in the polyobject crusher in MAP01.
- Fixed: A player that has no body (as in the head popped off in Heretic
  and Hexen) must not be resurrected.
- Fixed: Repeatable switches that are being activated while the switch
  animation was still running didn't react properly.
- Fixed: Not all paths in P_LoadSegs freed the vertchanged array.
- Fixed: With infinitely tall actors on P_CheckPosition must not
  check for stepping on things.
- Fixed: R_FakeFlat used the control sector's floor light level for
  ceilings of deep water areas.
- Fixed: Dormant floating monsters still adjusted their height to their
  target.
- Fixed: Invisible special things should never create terrain splashes.
- Changed: The Demon no longer reduces the actual state durations for
  fast mode. Now this is done by AActor::SetState and controlled by
  actor flags.
- Fixed: Friendly monsters are now completely excluded fron being counted
  as kills.

April 15, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Changed -warp for ExMy to use atoi to parse the parameters. This is
  more robust than reading the characters directly.
- Expanded thing and line args to 32 bit.
- Extended Makewad so it can write Zip files in addition to WAD files.

April 14, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Moved SC_CheckFloat into sc_man.cpp.
- Fixed several issues with the DECORATE parser:
  * Floating point parameters couldn't be parsed correctly
  * Some code pointers used parameters incorrectly.
  * Parameters with default value 1 didn't work as expected
- Added GZDoom's HI_START/HI_END lump namespace. Even though it doesn't do
  anything (yet) suppporting it allows to make WADs that use hires texture
  replacements but are able to run with ZDoom as well.
- Added GZDoom's Zip-support but changed it so that lumps are sorted
  alphabetically.
- Added the missing file 'flac/private/float.h' to the repository.
- Added: For Zip-support the sound code has to be able to load music data 
  from memory, not just from files.
- Re-added I_SetMusicVolume to optionally reduce the music volume in Strife
  conversations.
- Fixed: The total game time must not be restored when loading a snapshot
  during a hub transition.
  
April 13, 2006
- Fix farchive.cpp swappers for GCC again. Now that they use entirely integer
  math, they should work with all GCC versions.
- Update FLAC readers to #define FLAC__NO_DLL to match the new FLAC builds.

April 13, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Made weapons/bowhit unlimited. With a limit of 2 it won't be played 
  consistently.
- Fixed: 'Give' worked for dead players.
- Added checks for sectors without lines to all Find* functions in p_sector.cpp
- Fixed: Dehacked patches weren't loaded when not playing Doom.
- Fixed: Thing_Remove must not remove living players from the map.
- Fixed: Using $MAP in SNDINFO overrode music definitions in MAPINFO. This 
  made it impossible to define music in MAPINFO for Hexen.
- Fixed: Resurrecting a morphed player must first restore the unmorphed 
  version.
- Fixed: Resurrect must set the player's weapon to a valid state.
- Fixed: The decal stretcher is supposed to stretch the decal to a specifiable
  size but it used that size as a scaling factor instead. The old code allowed
  a maximum scaling factor of 4 which masked this bug to a large extent but
  with the increased precision the blood smears were stretched to abnormal
  proportions.
- Fixed: A non-spectral attack set any spectral target to its missile state.
  This is not supposed to happen.
- Fixed: The Prison Key was misspelled in the pickup message.
- Added missing lock messages for Strife.
- Fixed some ammo pickup values for Strife.
- Added the missing messages when killing a spectre in Strife.
- Fixed: DImpactDecal's default constructor called ChangeStatNum which caused
  a crash. Now it calls DBaseDecal's constructor that allows changing the
  statnum.
- Added additive translucency to the Ironlich's projectiles.
- Added a check for AInventory to PickConversationReply before giving an item
  to the player. This could crash if non-inventory items were given.
- Added a few console commands useful for map testing:
  * 'monster' lists all monsters and their position.
  * 'items' does the same for items.
  * 'changesky' changes the sky texture. Useful for trying out different skies.
  * 'linetarget' prints some information about the monster the player is aiming 
    at.

April 12, 2006
- Fixed: Using printinv before starting a game crashed.
- Fixed: DMover::MovePlane() would not stop moving the plane when it exactly
  reached its target height unless it was a floor moving down.
- Fixed: Actors that can't attack should not be valid haters for Thing_Hate.
- Fixed: AArtiBlastRadius::BlastActor() should not set MF2_SLIDE for missiles.
- Fixed: sdl/i_input.cpp should check !iscntrl() before generating EV_GUI_Char
  messages.
- Added Jim's Makefile.linux.
- Changed: Decal scales now use full precision fixed point numbers.
- Changed: Keeping impact decals in their own statlist is enough to keep track
  of them for when one needs to be destroyed. There's no need to maintain a
  separate list for them.
- Fixed: Decal actors did not spread their decals across neighboring walls.
- Fixed: Decal groups did not initialize their IDs and could not be reliably
  used with the decal actor.
- Fixed: Decals on moving polyobjects were not interpolated. R_RenderDecal()
  now uses the decal's LeftDistance to calculate its visible location, so it
  always stays in sync with the wall's vertices. This also lets me dump some
  code from the polyobjects that maintained the decals' (x, y) coordinates.
  Also, the decals' x and y information is redundant and can be removed.
  Doing this revealed a bug with slider decals and horizontal sliding:
  That is, it didn't work at all. I have opted to simply remove the horizontal
  sliding support so that I don't have to worry about what happens when a
  decal slides across the edge of a wall.
- Fixed: DBaseDecal::LeftDistance was calculated as a 30.2 fixed point number.
  It should be 2.30 fixed point.

April 12, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: SAVEVER was still 231 although MINSAVEVER was 232.
- Fixed: Decal spreading used an incorrect z-coordinate. It has to use
  the one originally passed to DImpactDecal::StaticCreate.

April 11, 2006
- Fixed: GCC misoptimized the SWAP macros in farchive.cpp.
- Fixed: Compiling with mingw once again works.
- Fixed: ACS improperly calculated the address of local variables when
  returning from one function to another function when the function that
  was called was used as part of an expression.
- Fixed: Using Thing_Hate with arg0 (hater) set to 0 from an open script
  could crash.
- Fixed: Some items along ledges in Hexen's MAP32 (Orchard of Lamentations)
  appeared at the bottom of the ledge (and consequently inside it) instead
  of on top of it because the items were placed directly on the lines.
  AActor::LinkToWorldForMapThing() needs to use the original R_PointOnLineSide()
  code to handle situations like this. Previously, it just used the original
  code for straight horizontal/vertical lines and used the new code for
  diagonal lines.
- Fixed: FWadCollection::MergeLumps() used in incorrect realloc.
- Fixed: FPlayList::NextLine() did not properly handle blank lines in the
  playlist.
- Changed: Decals now use lightweight thinkers instead of actors. (76 bytes
  versus 396, so you save 320k if you have 1024 decals present.)
- Fixed: Wads added with pullin were loaded immediately after the IWAD.
  Exec files are now processed immediately before -file but after autoloading
  wads in D_DoomMain().
- Fixed: sdl/i_system.h unconditionally defined SHARE_DIR, preventing
  redefinition from the command line.
- Fixed: The standard way to include SDL.h is <SDL.h>, not <SDL/SDL.h>.
- Fixed: Returned FActiveInterpolation::HashKey()'s return type to size_t,
  avoiding a pointer truncation warning.

April 11, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: Strife's dialogs don't give weapons to the player he already has.
- Fixed: The INDIANA cheat in Hexen gives 25 of each item, not just 1.
- Fixed: The stair builder's compatibility mode must do a linear search
  for sectors. Searching the hash chain doesn't work here.
- Fixed: Any monster with a TakeSpecialDamage method should call the
  super class's method instead of simply returning the damage amount.
- Fixed: Hexen's mash monsters cannot be frozen. No matter how you kill
  them they just vanish. This means they need the NOICEDEATH flag.
- Fixed: Morphing a monster must also copy its translucency settings.
- Fixed: The first Macil must react to weapon fire, even though he 
  doesn't get hurt by it.
- Fixed: Anything with a raise state needs the MF_CORPSE flag when dying
  because otherwise it can't be revived.
- Fixed: Player names in Heretic, Hexen nand Strife could only be 13
  characters because the input routine did an unnecessary font size check.
- Added: After saving the game the savegame should be checked
  and in case of an error an appropriate message be output.
- Fixed: The pig player had an initial health of 100, not 30.
- Fixed: Morphing a player removes the armor after transferring the
  inventory to the morphed version - but it tried to remove it from the
  unmorphed player instead.
- Fixed: Heretic uses Backspace to activate the Tome of Power by default.
- Fixed: 'Use all' should not try to use puzzle items.
- Made FileReader's methods virtual. Right now this isn't important
  but when ZIP support will be added it is needed. Also added a 
  MemoryReader class that derives from FileReader.
- Added a pointer check to DI_Acquire and DI_Unacquire. GZDoom definitely
  had problems with that so it might be a good idea to always check these
  pointers.
- Added an engine signature to the savegame. The inability to distinguish
  between ZDoom and GZDoom savegames constantly forced me to use some ugly 
  tricks which broke the versioning system. This may also be useful for
  other derivates that have to save additional data in a savegame.
- Due to the savegame version bump I removed all compatibility code.
- I had to bump the minimum savegame version because I got some strange
  effects with old savegames. On the positive side, this allows me to
  do a few more radical changes to the savegame code. ;)
- Fixed: CanvasTextures weren't saved in a savegame.
- Fixed: Multiple warp commands for the same texture were cumulative.
- Changed FPatchTexture::MakeTexture and FIMGZTexture::MakeTexture so they
  don't re-initialize the texture's size information repeatedly. This can
  cause problems if code was added that manipulates these values after loading
  the textures.
- Changed FPatchTexture::GetDimensions to use ReopenLumpNum instead of
  OpenLumpNum. Once ZIP handling is added the current code won't work anymore
  without adding a highly expensive copy operator to FWadLump.
- Added Transfer_WallLight special. This is similar to Transfer_Floor/Ceilinglight
  but affects walls instead.
- Fixed: P_TestActivateLine must check whether a valid actor is trying
  to activate the line.
- Added a check for MF2_NOTELEPORT to the special activation check for
  Booms generic triggers. This excludes most items from activating these
  lines that are not supposed to do that.
- Added a sv_dropstyle CVAR so that the way items are dropped is no longer
  dependent on the game being played.
- Added MF4_FRIGHTENED flag from .96x.
- Added a CVAR that disables the automap background graphic in Heretic
  and Hexen.
- Added more color options to the automap, including the option to show
  secrets.
- Added menu option for the monster movement interpolation CVAR.
- Fixed: Strife's grenades don't make bouncing sounds.
- Fixed: Strife's grenades lose 50% of their momentum when bouncing,
  not 30% like in Hexen.
- Fixed: HexenHack must be reset for each MAPINFO lump being parsed.
- Turned monster falling damage into a level flag so that it can be
  used in all games, not just Hexen.
- Added the map's lump name to the savegame information. This is useful
  for those who remember maps by their lump name and not the description.
- Added a total game time counter and made the total time display on
  the intermission screen operrable. Also added an optional total time
  display for the automap.
- Added support for full hub intermission statistics. To make this work
  properly level.time is now being reset after changing hubs.
- Added GZDoom's local SNDINFO/SNDSEQ code. This was supposed to be in
  .96x but that was cancelled before I had the chance.
- Made DCanvas::FlatFill virtual so it can be overridden by other
  types of canvases (e.g. OpenGL.)
- Fixed: CR_UNTRANSLATED was uninitialized for FON2 fonts
- Fixed: Hexen uses a view height of 48, not 41.
- Changed: Multiplayer weapons will be spawned in coop games now
  unless the player explicitly disables this. There are many WADs
  out there that need the additional weapons in coop games.
- Added code that remaps MF_NOSECTOR to RF_INVISIBLE for all items
  touched by Dehacked and for ABossEye. MF_NOSECTOR makes any
  item completely deaf so it is very dangerous to use with monsters
  or other things that depend on their sound target.
- Fixed: The Dehacked code cleared one of the translation flags.
- Fixed: The dehacked parser must set EnglishStrings to NULL after
  freeing the memory.
- Copied a fix for restoring the weapon slots from 2.1.0.
- Fixed: APathFollower::Interpolate needs some NULL pointer checks.
- Added MF2_NOTELEPORT to ABlood and AIceChunk. Teleporting blood can 
  seriously mess up one-time teleporters - plus it looks just weird.
- Fixed: It was possible to use things through closed walls when the wall
  was further away than 64 map units.
- Added a check for MF3_BLOODLESSIMPACT to P_LineAttack so that bloodless
  hitscan attacks can be created.
- Added a check to P_CheckSlopeWalk that prevents sliding when hanging over
  a sloped dropoff.
- Fixed: The line id hash chains used signed shorts to link their elements.
  This completely broke line manipulation for linedef indices >= 32768.
- Fixed: Changed PL_SKYFLAT from 0x8000 to 0x10000 because otherwise it
  doesn't work with linedef indices >= 32768. Also expanded sector_t::sky
  from WORD to int to make this work.
- Added the flag parser fix from GZDoom. It was still incorrect.
- Added an escape flag to sc_man. This was necessary to parse the frame names
  correctly which can contain backslashes so they must be excluded from
  converting \" to ".
- Fixed: The 'ELVIS' cheat code wasn't terminated with 255.
- Fixed: When an object without any death state dies it has to be destroyed.
- Added 'nofog' parameter to Thing_Move
- Added a check for Teleport_ZombieChanger to P_TranslateTeleportThings.
- Fixed: Dumpmap crashed when the loaded map has GL nodes because it tried
  to access the linedef of a miniseg. Needless to say, the BSP that is
  written in this case is completely broken but at least it doesn't crash
  anymore.
- Fixed: z-momentum application in P_ZMovement was incompatible with
  the original method. Unless MF2_FLOATBOB is set it must be done before
  applying gravity to momz.
- Fixed: AActor::Massacre caused an infinite loop when it wasn't able to
  hurt the actor.
- Fixed: Due to movement interpolation the viewsector could be incorrect
  if the actual camera's position and the interpolated position were not
  in the same sector.
- Fixed: Assigning an empty string to a 'string' object NULLed
  the Chars pointer. This cannot be done because it makes the
  string object invalid.
- Fixed: Default intermission handling for E1-E3 should only happen when
  playing Doom 1 and Heretic.
- Fixed: 'Give all' cheat must not try to give an item of type 'All'.
- Fixed: In rare circumstances DBoundingBox::AddToBox could produce
  incorrect results.
- Fixed: The node builder still used NO_INDEX for initializing non-existent
  sidedefs.
- Added MaxStepHeight and MaxDropoffHeight actor properties to DECORATE.
- Added new code pointers from GZDoom: A_FireAssaultGun, A_FadeIn and
  the target inventory functions. Also added changes to several other
  code pointers.
- Fixed: The FlameThrowerParts were missing the IF_INVBAR flag.
- Added a third parameter to A_BFGSpray to customize the amount of damage.
- Added A_DualPainAttack code pointer submitted by Justin for GZDoom.
- Fixed: AFatShot must have a height of 8, not 32.
- Fixed: AFighterPLayer::DoHealingRadius initialized the armor item
  incorrectly so it was ineffective.
- Fixed: Strife's Brass Key needs a DoomEdNum of 39.
- Removed all the obsolete code and variables from the keys. With the
  LOCKDEFS lump the original key numbers were deleted anyway and the
  NeedKey messages are taken from the lump now.

April 10, 2006 (Changes by Graf Zahl)
- Fixed: The Teleporter Beacon was missing the pickup message.
- Made the IronLich's projectiles bright. Using them in non-bright state
  in dark sectors looks truly odd.
- Fixed: Using bot_observer cleared the FRIENDLY flag off the player.
- Fixed: Changed some decals from DecalScorch to DecalScorchLower.
- Fixed: Added the missing intermission lumps and LOCKDEFS to zdoom.wad
- Changed the damage formula for Strife's dagger. This change has already
  been added to the 2.1.0 source but not to the current version.
- Added a call to P_HitFriend to A_SentinelRefire to prevent it from shooting
  at friends.
- Fixed: The Inquisitor's grenades should not teleport.
- Fixed: The Inquisitor isn't supposed to be thrust by damage so its mass
  has to be increased.
- Fixed: Strife's Inquisitor can be hurt by radius damage as long as this 
  damage comes from a non-Inquisitor. 
- Fixed: AArtiDarkServant::Use must always report successful use of the item.
  This function cannot fail. It either spawns a Minotaur or a new artifact
  but never nothing at all.
- Fixed: Hexen's temp flames have two spawn IDs each. Since ZDoom doesn't
  support multiple spawn IDs per item I added copies of these objects
  to assign the second set od IDs.
- Fixed: Hexen's wall torch was missing the MF4_FIXMAPTHINGPOS flag.
- Fixed: A_CStaffCheckBlink must call A_WeaponReady because otherwise the
  weapon bobbing becomes slightly erratic.
- Fixed: AGoldWandPuff2 had incorrect values set for flags2.
- Clamped the vertical speed of Heretic's Mace's balls. When shot at a high
  vertical angle their movement becomes erratic.
- Fixed: Doom's corpses must clear the MF3_ISMONSTER flag inherited from
  their monster parents.

April 9, 2006
- Fixed: The strupr() implementation in w_wad.cpp relied on compiler-dependant
  behavior.
- Fixed fix: ParseActorProperties() still wasn't sending + or - to
  ActorFlagSetOrReset().
- Fixed: [GZ] An item without use state won't be removed when being picked up.
  The call to GoAwayAndDie is missing.
- Fixed: [GZ]  A_GiveInventory sets the amount to give to a value passed to
  this function. This is ok for everything except Health items. They should
  give their original amount multiplied with the passed parameter.

April 3, 2006
- Fixed: Potential buffer overrun when launching timidity.

March 13, 2006
- Fixed: ActorFlagSetOrReset() wasn't receiving the + or - character from
  ParseActorProperties().
- Fixed: The decorate FindFlag() function returned flags from ActorFlags
  instead of the passed flags set.
- Fixed: The CHT_CHAINSAW, CHT_POWER, CHT_HEALTH, and CHT_RESSURECT needed
  NULL player->mo checks.
- Fixed: The "give all" command didn't give the backpack in Doom, and it
  must give the backpack before giving ammo.
- Fixed: P_SetPsprite() must not call the action function if the player is
  not attached to an actor. This can happen, for instance, if the level is
  destroyed while the player is holding a powered-up Phoenix Rod. As part
  of its EndPowerup() function, it sets the psprite to the regular version,
  but the player actor has already been destroyed.
- Fixed: FinishThingdef() needs to check for valid names, because weapons
  could have inherited valid pointers from their superclass.
- Fixed: fuglyname didn't work.
- Fixed: Redefining $ambient sounds leaked memory.
- Added Jim's crashcatcher.c fix for better shell support.
- VC7.1 seems to have no trouble distinguishing between passing a (const
  TypeInfo *) reference to operator<< and the generic, templated (object *)
  version, so a few places that can benefit from it now use it. I believe
  VC6 had problems with this, which is why I didn't do it all along. The
  function's implementation was also moved out of dobject.cpp and into
  farchive.cpp.
- Fixed: UnpackPixels() unpacked all chunks in a byte, which is wrong for the
  last byte in a row if the image width is not an even multiple of the number
  pixels per byte.
- Fixed: P_TranslateLineDef() should only clear monster activation for secret
  useable lines, not crossable lines.
- Fixed: Some leftover P_IsHostile() calls still needed to be rewritten.
- Fixed: AWeaponHolder::Serialize() wrote the class type in all circumstances.

March 12, 2006
- Fixed: A_SpawnItem() should use CopyFriendliness().
- Fixed: AExplosiveBarrel should have MF2_MCROSS set.
- Fixed: Passing 0 numrays to A_BFGSpray should default to 40.
- Fixed: New A_JumpIfCloser() function.
- Future-proofing: thingdef.cpp/FindState() allows the 2.1 names for
  SwitchingDecorations.
- Fixed: ASwitchingDecoration declared itself as deriving from AActor instead of
  ASwitchableDecoration.

March 9, 2006
- Fixed: AWeaponHolder::Serialize() did not call its supermethod.

March 1, 2006
- Rewrote MusicVolumes handling so it's a list and not an array.
- Removed I_SetMusicVolume(). It isn't used.
- Moved P_IsFriend(), P_IsHostile(), and P_GetSpecies() into AActor.

February 18, 2006
- Various fixes for compilation with GCC/Linux.
- Various fixes from Graf Zahl: Wrong blood color with P_BloodSplatter2() and
  P_RipperBlood(). Wrong MF3_BLOODLESSIMPACT check in PIT_CheckThing().
  P_BloodSplatter() used R_PointToAngle(). A_CPosRefire() did not check for
  hitting a friend. A_CentaurDefend() did not clear the reflective flag.
  DHUDMessage::ResetText() did not check for con_scaletext==2. Wrong Raven
  scroller speeds for COMPATF_RAVENSCROLL off. P_Init() should call
  P_InitKeyMessages(). Missing decorate decal code from decallib.cpp. New
  FFontChar1 code only made it into 2.1.0 and not 2.0.x. Missing copy
  constructor for FMusicVolume.
- Fixed: ACustomInventory::TryPickup() failed to call the superclass
  implementation of the function.
- Fixed: Friendly pain elementals killed by a player shot friendly lost souls
  that attacked the player. Now those lost souls aren't friendly.

February 6, 2006
- Fixed: Except for A_Explode512, all of Strife's A_Explode functions also call
  P_RecursiveSound.
- SpectralLightningSpot's RenderStyle is now STYLE_Translucent. It isn't really
  part of the lightning itself, so it should probably not be additive.
- Fixed: Macil2 and the Oracle are invulnerable to the first stage Sigil, and
  the first Macil should be completely unkillable.
- Fixed: The FlameThrowerParts' spawn state was unset, and it used a generic
  pickup message.
- Fixed: Strife step heights vary depending on the type of actor: If it bleeds
  it can go up 16 unit steps, if it's a missile it can go up 4 unit steps, and
  everything else can go up 24 unit steps. And everything can stand over a 32
  unit dropoff. MaxStepHeight and MaxDropOffHeight are now actor properties.
- Fixed: Strife floating monsters are not blocked by monster blocking lines, so
  they all need to have MF3_NOBLOCKMONST set.
- Fixed: APowerCoupling::Die() should destroy the unbroken coupling.
- Fixed: AActor::TakeSpecialDamage() should allow damage if the actor has
  no death state at all. (Taken from GZDoom)
- Fixed: Killing something that drops an alarm with the second-stage mauler
  would not show the alarm text if it was directly hit by the main torpedo.
  Added a third argument to P_SpawnSubMissile() that indicates what the
  new missile's "target" should be, so if the missile dies right away, it
  has the correct target information.
- Fixed: Added Graf Zahl's fix for manually closing animated doors with
  something inside them.
- Fixed: The A key should be bound to +jump by default in Strife.
- Fixed: F_BunnyScroll() should fill the widescreen border with black, not
  the FinaleFlat.
- Fixed: Strife linetype 52 can be used to advance to the next map by setting
  its tag to 0. It should also be flagged repeatable.
- Fixed: A_Look2() is supposed to randomly choose self->SpawnState + 3 if
  MF4_STANDSTILL is unset, not + 4.
- A_AcolyteDie() now resets the acolyte's RenderStyle to turn off any shadow
  effects they may have.

January 24, 2006 -- First changes of 2006! 1.5 months later! :(
- Added a new level.maptime variable that keeps track of the time you've been
  on a single level and is unaffected by hubs.
- Fixed: ASoulsphere::Use() could reduce your health.
- Fixed: cht_Suicide() did not clear the MF2_INVULNERABLE flag.
- Increased the sidedef limit to 2^32-1.
- Fixed: Stacked sectors inside a skybox would be drawn from the player's
  origin instead of the skybox's origin, which would easily lead to infinite
  recursion because the engine would try to render the skybox again instead
  of the other side of the stack. In order to avoid any other infinite
  recursion problems, the maximum number of skybox visplanes per scene has now
  been capped at 100.
- Changed the inventory flag IF_CHEATNOTWEAPON to the weapon flag
  WIF_CHEATNOTWEAPON.

December 11, 2005
- Started integrating changes from 96x into 2.0.99.

December 10, 2005
- Fixed: GetFinaleText() did not null-terminate the string it retrieved.
- Fixed: When changing levels, sky1pos and sky2pos were not reset to 0.
- Removed the check for 26,26 at offset 33 in SPC files because somebody found
  a file that had them as 0,0 instead, and some players played it fine.
- Fixed: Before resorting to "Person", the dialogue code should use the actor's
  tag name as a default name.
- Increased the Entity's alpha value to 50% to make it more visible.
- Fixed: F_StartSlideshow() needs to reset any blending.
- When a Macil speech ends, the level's original music is now restored.
- Fixed: The music for Strife's slideshows is D_DARK and not D_SLIDE. Go figure.

December 4, 2005
- Removed the ancient and unused Fixed(Mul|Div)_(ASM|C) functions.
- Discovered the GCC outputs nice code for MulScale and friends, so I removed
  the assembly for those routines in gccinlines.h. Alas, the same cannot be said
  of DivScale's variants.
- Removed the assembly code for BigShort and BigLong and replaced it with
  compiler intrinsics provided by VC++.

December 1, 2005
- Backported miscellaneous sc_man.cpp fixes from 2.1.0.
- Fixed: P_BobWeapon() checked flags instead of WeaponFlags for WIF_DONTBOB.
- R_ProjectSprite() now checks for NULL things passed to it.
- Fixed: The game crashed if a slope thing of type 9500 or 9501 was placed
  directly on its target line. Now you get a warning in the console instead.
- Returned Berserk's behavior to giving you 100 health instead of 100% health.
- Changed: When no screenshot_dir is specified, the game now tries to save
  screenshots to the program directory instead of the current directory. If
  you really want screenshots to be saved to the current directory, you can
  do so by setting screenshot_dir to "."
- Fixed: StringFormat::VWorker cleared the zero flag for numbers. (I know I
  tested this, so I'm not sure when it went wrong.)
- Fixed: The game did not check if actors had pain states before putting them
  in their pain states.
- Fixed: The shazam cheat could not deactivate the Tome of Power, nor did it
  display any text informing you of its action.
- Added additional decals from Graf Zahl's DECALDEF.
- Updated the obituaries in english-us.txt for Heretic to reflect the published
  names of various Heretic monsters.
- Fixed: There is no reason why the Heretic and Hexen status bars should clamp
  the displayed health to a maximum of 100.
- Fixed: P_PlayerInSpecialSector() duplicated the damage done by
  P_PlayerOnSpecialFlat().
- Fixed: The actor serializer was off by one when checking the number of
  conversation nodes in a script.
- Fixed: In Strife dialogues, yes texts are printed even when it jumps
  immediately to another dialogue node. I think this is bad design, and the
  yes text should be part of the normal dialogue, but the person in the
  east room of MAP27 abuses this, so I need to support it too. This also means
  the notify text is no longer hidden when the menu is up. (Maybe they
  mistakenly made it jump, and you were really supposed to try talking to him
  again when he tells you the master doesn't like visitors.)
- Fixed: Anybody in Strife who does not have their name provided in their
  dialogue script should use the default name "Person".
- Fixed: P_RecursiveSound() did not consider closed split doors as closed.
- Fixed: MummyFX1 and Whirlwind should have the MF2_SEEKERMISSILE flag set.
- Fixed: A_VileChase() did not clear the MF3_CRASHED flag.
- Fixed: P_SpawnPlayer() should always attach the StatusBar if the
  consoleplayer is spawning.
- Fixed: HateTarget did not take damage due to its lack of a death state.
- Fixed: CheckInventory(), TakeInventory(), and GiveInventory need NULL type
  checks.
- Fixed: SC_GetString() did not understand escaped quote characters in strings.
- Fixed: There were synchronization issues while drawing the console. Calls to
  DrawTexture() can trigger input events to be processed, which can cause the
  contents of the console to change WHILE THE CONSOLE IS BEING DRAWN. So now
  any changes that would alter the contents of the console text buffer are
  deferred until after the buffer is drawn, and a copy of the command line is
  drawn instead of the real command line.

November 22, 2005
- Fixed: Dssswtchx and dspistol are obviously wrong choices for Strife menu
  sounds. I don't think it uses anything for those sounds, but I picked analogs
  for them anyway.
- Fixed: Merchants ignored attacks from "silent" weapons.
- Fixed: Strife humans did not play their "yeargh!" sound for their zap deaths.
- Added a new Travelled() method for inventory items. This is called each time
  an item travels to a new map and gives it a chance to perform any needed
  reinitialization. Specficially, PowerTargeter needs it to set the player's
  psprites again.
- Fixed: Dropping coins should do so in increments of 50 if you have enough, not
  increments of 1.
- Added IF_UNDROPPABLE to HealthTraining and GunTraining. Because HealthTraining
  also gives GunTraining when picked up, you could cheat by dropping the
  HealthTraining item and picking it up to get as many GunTraining upgrades as
  you wanted. GunTraining doesn't really need to be undroppable; the flag is just
  there for it for the sake of symmetry.
- Fixed: It looks like just about everything in Strife should have MF2_FLOORCLIP
  set. Strife probably applied floorclip to everything without MF_NOGRAVITY set.
- Fixed: The perfectly vertical missile movement fix was backwards with regards
  to damage values.
- Fixed: AddCommandString() scanned past terminating '\0's in unclosed
  strings while searching for semicolons that break commands. Thus, if the
  previous command added had a semicolon in just the right place, it could
  try to add it again.
- Fixed: The fly cheat did not check to make sure you had a body.

November 18, 2005
- Fixed: You could create a chain reaction where merchants would continually
  enter their pain state because there was a delay between the time when they
  alerted and the time they alerted others.
- Fixed: If the Inquisitor died while flying, it would continue to play the
  flying sound.
- Fixed: The LEGO cheat didn't check if the Sigil was successfully added and
  would set the player to the NULL weapon if it wasn't (which happens with
  the shareware).
- Fixed: Macil was alerted by water splashing.
- Reworded some of the compatibility options menu items so they fit on
  the screen when playing Strife.
- Fixed: The Oracle's Death checked the wrong quest item to determine if
  you had already killed Macil.

November 17, 2005
- Fixed: Various Strife actors had MF_COUNTKILL that didn't need it:
  Beggar, KneelingGuy, Macil1, RatBuddy, and AcolyteToBe.
- Fixed: PowerMask and PowerShadow both need the IF_HUBPOWER flag.
- Fixed: The Strife quest log should be initialized with the text "Find
  help".

November 14, 2005
- Fixed: ClientObituary() crashed if the killing player didn't have a
  weapon.
- Fixed: The Touch functions assumed the toucher was a valid player and
  crashed if it wasn't.
- Fixed: APlayerPawn::Die() assumed the actor was always associated with
  a player and crashed if it wasn't and you had weapon dropping turned on.
- Fixed: There were two pfile variables defined in R_InitTextures().

November 13, 2005
- Fixed: The user-configurable BOOM startup strings were always printed,
  even if they were empty.

November 8, 2005
- Fixed: APowerStrength::GetBlend()'s equation did not match Doom's.
- Fixed: If you have weapon sprites in a wad and try to use a frame from
  that sprite that does not exist, the game accesses might crash. Fixing
  this involves two things: Make the range checks in R_DrawPSprite()
  unconditional, so they exist in both debug and release builds. Also add
  a check for the Null texture to catch "holes" in the available frames.
- Fixed: Setmodeneeded is always true before starting a game, because it
  only gets cleared when the StatusBar is around. The most obvious
  manifestation of this problem is that you cannot move left and right
  in the video modes menu before starting a game.
- Fixed: The "give all" cheat did not give a backpack, and the non-console
  equivalents always gave you a backpack, even if you weren't playing Doom.
- Fixed: The "give armor" cheat gave you armor with a SavePercent of .5 in
  Heretic. This would be correct for the others games, but not for Heretic,
  where .5 is what the lesser armor provides.

November 7, 2005
- New: Games saved for different PWADs but the same IWAD now show up in
  orange on the save/load menu.
- Fixed: R_RenderViewToCanvas() did nothing if viewactive was false. Thus,
  savegame screenshots would be garbage if you saved while looking at the
  automap.
- To avoid potential conflicts with the Windows headers, the LONG and SHORT
  routines were renamed to LittleLong and LittleShort. BELONG and BESHORT
  were also renamed to BigLong and BigShort to match.
- Fixed: S_ChangeMusic() had a cast from 'const char *' to 'char *' that was
  missed by VC++ 7.1 and GCC, but not the latest VC++ 2005 beta.
- Fixed: Although bit 27 of the actor's flag is now used for something
  different than in Doom, it's okay to specify it by number in a Dehacked
  patch, because it's used to set the color translation. When the translation
  is set, it will be 0'ed then.
- Fixed: FActorInfo::ApplyDefaults() should initialize datastr to NULL.
- Fixed: TArray::Delete's parameter should be unsigned.
- Fixed: The fix for rotating polyobjects broke polyobject doors.
- Fixed: Using the IDBEHOLDS cheat did not give you full health.
- Backported the fix for scrolling Heretic/Hexen/Strife specials from 2.1.0.
- Increased KneelingGuy's height to 17 so that you cannot step on top of the
  projector without jumping.
- Added a confirmation screen for the menu choices that reset your options.
- Added a new automap menu underneath the display options menu. Moved all the
  automap options into it and added a few new ones.

November 2, 2005
- Fixed: WIF_NOAUTOFIRE did not actually do anything.
- Added zloba's save/load console commands.
- Adjusted Static_Init:Init_Color so that you don't have to specify both
  fog and color with it.
- Fixed: A_GenWizard() and A_SpawnBishop() did not decrement total_monsters if
  the monster spawned inside something and needed to be destroyed.
- Fixed: Hexen monsters also move faster in nightmare mode.
- Added a map color customization menu.
- Renamed the "Standard map colors" option to "Use traditional Doom map colors".
- Fixed: Switching the MIDI device after a one-shot song had finished would
  try to restart the song.
- Removed the BufferReturnEvent from music_midi_stream.cpp, since it was
  unused.

October 26, 2005
- Merged in Chris's Linux patch.
- Fixed: Redefining a decal that had already been assigned to an actor would
  not update the actor's reference to the decal.
- Fixed: CheckForPushSpecial() could pass a NULL actor to P_ActivateLine() if
  a missile did not have an "owner."
- Fixed: snd_reset assumed GSnd was valid, but it wouldn't be if you passed
  -nosound on the command line.
- Fixed: When a doll-spawned minotaur in Hexen died, it checked to see if any
  other minotaur were still up for that player. It assumed there were no free-
  standing minotaurs and crashed if there were.

October 24, 2005
- Added armor->BecomeItem() calls to ABasicArmorPickup::Use() and
  ABasicArmorBonus::Use(). AActor::AddInventory() no longer calls BecomeItem()
  itself.

October 22, 2005
- Fixed: FloorAndCeiling_LowerRaise would move one or the other but not both.
- Fixed: PIT_RadiusAttack() calculated negative distances for things exploding
  directly above other things.
- Fixed: Ripper missiles ignored MF3_BLOODLESSIMPACT and always sprayed blood
  onto the walls.
- Fixed: Firing a missile into a wall while standing right next to the wall
  would not cause any specials to activate on that wall.

October 18, 2005
- Changed: DThinker::DestroyThinkersInList() performed a pointer cleanup after
  destroying each and every thinker. The better thing to do is clean up in the
  functions that call it: DestroyAllThinkers() and DestroyMostThinkers().

October 17, 2005
- Fixed: BloodySkull and IceChunkHead are supposed to subclass PlayerChunk, not
  PlayerPawn.
- Fixed: Behaviors for Generic_Floor change types 2 and 3 were swapped.
- Fixed: Non-320x200 INTERPICs once again display properly.
- Changed drawing operations in F_BunnyScroller() so that non-320x200 background
  images should work.
- Fixed: The m_Dist member of DPolyAction was declared signed when it should have
  been unsigned.
- Fixed: SetScriptState() in p_acs.cpp did not check to make sure the ACS thinker
  actually existed.
- Fixed: Crashing when travelling between maps in a hub. For some reason the list
  of pointers for AActor used 12-byte-wide pointers-to-members. Every other class
  (including those that derive from AActor) use 4-byte-wide values. This left
  DObject::PointerSubstitution() and DObject::DestroyScan() able to identify only
  the first pointer declared in AActor. Rather than try to figure out why
  pointers-to-members of AActor are weird, I decided to revert to my original
  implementation: An array of offsets into the class. GCC complained about this,
  which is why I switched to a pointers-to-members implementation. But I found a
  way to make GCC compile it without warning, so yay!
  
  And since I was working with this code anyway, I decided to make a change that-
  is hopefully a speed optimization. Rather than walking up the chain of TypeInfos
  every time an object's pointers need to be checked, I now do this once and build
  an array of every pointer in a class instance (as opposed to just those pointers
  defined for that class and not any of its superclasses). This should mean fewer
  scattered memory accesses and hence, better cache utilization.
  
  (Question: Why did this problem show up in 2.0.97 and not 2.0.96? The only
  relevant change to the code was a macro to make the array const for VC++ but not
  for GCC, because some GCC optimizations tried to write to it at runtime despite
  its constness.)

September 26, 2005
- Released this old code as 2.0.97.
- Backported the text-based LANGUAGE and IMF code from 2.1.0.
- Updated to zlib 1.2.3.

February 21, 2005
- Provided alternate versions of the TArray-related friend template functions for
  the string and name classes. I have no idea which compiler is right, but VC++ is
  certainly nicer about it.

February 19, 2005
- Fixed: In C mode, SC_GetString() would not consider '-' to be a token.
- Added a global name table.

February 18, 2005
- Added lots of explicit casts and changed some types to turn off 64-bit compatibility
  warnings.
- Added a string class I've been playing with for a while now and made some
  adjustments to TArray so that it can work with non-basic types.

February 11, 2005
- Removed the MOD_FIRE hack in PIT_RadiusAttack and replaced it with a new thrustless
  flag to P_RadiusAttack.
- Removed the multiplayer check from AInventory::ShouldRespawn(). Now the dmflag is
  always respected, even without alwaysapplydmflags.
- Added a check for a NULL StatusBar to PlayerIsGone() in d_net.cpp.
- Fixed: ADehackedPickup::TryPickup() set the MF_DROPPED flag. This flag is now set
  by default, so it should clear it instead. This kept hacked weapons from staying
  and respawning, because the RealPickup it tests against was always flagged as
  dropped.
- Fixed: The MagePlayer used A_Scream instead of A_PlayerScream when he died.
- Fixed: The Heresiarch spawned new balls above its head after it killed its target
  and re-entered its SpawnState.
- Fixed: Using chasecam while spying on another player would not show that player.
- Rewrote the spy code to not need displayplayer.
- Switched to the combination of DirectDrawCreate/QueryInterface to obtain an
  IDirectDraw2 interface. That should be slightly more compatible, since
  DirectDrawCreate can create an IDirectDraw interface even if it isn't properly
  registered.

February 10, 2005
- Fixed: The screen fading ACS commands did not work when viewing through a camera
  because DBaseStatusBar::BlendView() did not think there was a player to get those
  values from. Now, the blend comes from either the player viewing from or the
  console player if the current view is not from a player.
- Fixed: Returning to a previously visited level in a hub with fewer players than you
  had when you left the level would result in "zombie" bodies from the former players.
  The fix is in G_UnSnapshotLevel(): After restoring the level, any actors that point
  to a player who is no longer in the game are destroyed.
- Fixed: P_ExplodeMissile() should zero the projectile's speed before putting it into
  its DeathState, not after. Strife's flamethrower needs it like this, and I'm not
  sure when or why it was moved to happen after the state change.
- Fixed: R_DrawSkyBoxes() needs to save and restore viewx and viewy as well as viewz
  for drawing masked items.
- Fixed: P_MorphPlayer() did not properly transfer ownership of inventory items, so
  when it destroyed the player's armor, it also unlinked anything after the armor in
  the player's inventory.
- Fixed: The Hexen players should call A_FireScream() on the first frame of their
  fire death, not the first shared frame of their fire death.
- Attached obituaries to the projectiles used by Doom's projectile weapons, so they
  can have obituaries again. This is just something I put off finishing when I changed
  from a means-of-death system to a damage type system.
- Fixed: Pain Elementals did not transfer their friendly flag to the Lost Souls
  they spawn. And since I've got the same code doing this sort of thing in several
  places, I replaced them all with a call to the new method AActor::CopyFriendliness.
- Fixed: Bots are idiots after co-op level changes because the CajunMaster forgets
  about them and so doesn't tell them to do anything different from what they were
  when the level change happened.
- Fixed: G_FinishTravel() needs to retrieve the next player before changing the
  current one's statnum.
- Made some fixes to SDLVideo's Lock() and and Update() synchronization.
- Fixed: DSimpleCanvas::Lock() and ::Unlock() did not properly use the lock count.
- Fixed: In Strife, the fastCrushAndRaise ceilings (line types 6 and 77) are twice
  as fast as their Doom counterparts.
- Fixed: Strife auto-uses the best ammo first, not the worst. I got confused because
  in Strife ARM1 is the best armor, but in Doom it's ARM2 that is best.
- Fixed: Strife does not double ammo at its highest skill level.
- New: Using Degnin Ore will drop it, similar to the Teleporter Beacon.
- Fixed: In nightmare skill, every actor is spawned with a reactiontime of 0. This
  make's Strife's HE Grenades explode immediately, because they use their reactiontime
  as a countdown timer. The solution: Only set the reactiontime to 0 for monsters.
  (Strife may not do this at all. I'm not sure.)

February 9, 2005
- New feature: Missiles with negative damage now give you health.
- Changed P_GiveBody so that it works with any actor, not just players.
- Fixed: Picking up a BasicArmorPickup without any existing BasicArmor gave you
  a new BasicArmor without calling BecomeItem to unlink it from the world. Since
  there are probably other areas where this happens, and it's kind of easy to forget
- Added a division-by-0 check to the very end of P_HitSlideLine for the very rare
  cases when inter3 ends up being 0.
- Clamped the upmove speed in P_PlayerThink() to avoid super fast speeds from
  joystick users.
- Fixed: A_SorcererRaise() did not transfer friendliness info to the new D'Sparil.
- Added: Trying to use actors that have the UsePuzzleItem special now works just
  like trying to use a wall with the same special: You use the item if you have it,
  and you say "hmm" if you don't.
- Fixed: APuzzleItem::Use() should not remove the item from the inventory but let
  the caller do it instead.
- Fixed: P_TranslateLineDef() should clear the ML_MONSTERSCANACTIVATE flag on lines
  with ML_SECRET set. Otherwise, monsters can open otherwise secret doors in Doom
  format maps.
- Renamed the Porkalator's missile sprite from EGGM to PRKM, so it doesn't have the
  same name as the Morph Ovum's missile.
- Fixed: The warp cheat was always applied to the local player and not the player who
  used it.
- TypeInfo::CreateDerivedClass() now initializes OwnedStates and NumOwnedStates for
  actors.
- Fixed: PrepWall and PrepLWall clamped the final texture column so that it was not
  visible unless it was fully visible.
- Fixed writing of RDosPlay raw songs. It was a very very very stupid mistake: I had
  the order of the register and data bytes reversed. Now it works fine, and since it
  took me a while to figure out the problem, ZDoom can now play raw OPL songs.

February 7, 2005
- Added the writeopl command to write a song in RDosPlay raw OPL format. Its usage is:
    writeopl [songname] <filename>
  If the currently playing song is a MUS song being played through the OPL emulation,
  then you just need to specify the filename. Otherwise, you need to provide the
  songname (such as D_E1M1) as well. Unfortunately, the result is unplayable with
  AdPlug, so I must be doing something wrong.

February 4, 2005
- Merged in Graf Zahl's Caverns of Darkness patch.
- Fixed: Using the screenshot command to specify a filename without any extension
  automatically adds the extension.

February 3, 2005
- Played around with polymost some more. The good: Wall projection is now totally
  independant of the non-polymost code, so walls don't get clipped to what would have
  been the screen boundaries without true look up/down. With the filled polygon mode,
  it looks awesome. The bad: I'm getting precision problems when clipping the left
  side of walls to SCISDIST. This problem is not present when clipping the right side,
  and it's not present in jfDuke, so what am I doing wrong? Setting SCISDIST to a large
  value like 128 makes the problem disappear, but that's much too large. Someday, when
  it can handle doing a second pass to draw behind you, SCISDIST needs to be as small as
  possible to avoid a visible gap between the front and back views.

February 2, 2005
- Added a damagetype parameter to AActor::TakeSpecialDamage(). The default implementation
  of this function now uses it to reject damage if the actor doesn't have a matching
  death state. (Meaning, you can leave an actor without a normal death state, and it will
  only take damage from special attacks.) Since this negates the need for A_TreeDeath,
  that function is gone.
- Fixed: The adjustment for negative y-offset, non-power-of-2-height textures is
  now only done for textures aligned at the top and not the bottom.
- Fixed: APowerFlight::DrawPowerup() did not check if SPFLY0 actually existed before
  using it.
- Fixed: P_SpeekerMissile() did not check for zero-speed actors, so you could get a
  division by zero error if it needed to move vertically.

January 30, 2005
- Threw together a quicx mock-up of a polymost-based renderer. It is essentially
  just the standard software renderer with some parts commented out and the clipping
  done with polymost instead of a few one-dimensional arrays. The display itself is
  just the standard view with the polymost view overlayed in wireframe.

January 29, 2005
- Fixed: BOOM-style carrying floors that use speeds values less than STOPSPEED
  no longer change the actor's momx and momy but are passed as extra parameters
  to P_XYMovement(). Faster speeds still change momx and momy, so conveyor belts
  can fling objects off of them.
- Fixed: Items in inventory would "scroll" on scrolling floors.
- Fixed: Every place that copies the friendly flag from one actor to another also
  needs to copy the FriendPlayer.
- Fixed: In A_Chase(), a friend's selection of target based on who last hurt the
  player did not take into consideration that a friend may have accidentally hurt
  the player.
- Fixed: P_NightmareRespawn() did not copy a monster's custom translation to
  its new body.
- Fixed: FMODStreamCapsule::Play() did not record the channel the stream was
  playing on, so you could not change its volume during playback.
- Added the sucktime mapinfo option. This is the time, in hours, that the
  player must play before the intermission tells them their time sucks. If this
  is 0, then they cannot suck. If they do suck, their time is still shown
  (unlike Doom) in the normal spot, with the suck above it. I had to shift the
  positions of the time displays in the Doom intermission a little so that there
  was room for the hour field. This is also retrievable with the GetLevelInfo()
  command by passing LEVELINFO_SUCK_TIME.
- Fixed: Using the suicide cheat on the "end of game hell hack" on E1M8 would
  infinitely loop because that sector type actually prevents you from dying,
  but the cheat code was waiting for you to die.

January 27, 2005
- Added mouse handling to the testpolymost screen so that I can actually drive
  it. That let me find a few more bugs in my port of the code that needed to be
  fixed.

January 26, 2005
- Changed the Puffy actor (used by Heretic's weredragon/beast's fireball trail)
  to do 0 damage. Similarly, A_LastZap() now sets the projectile it spawns to
  do 0 damage so it can be once again like Hexen.
- Fixed: Picking up an ammo item for the first time with more than the max
  amount for that ammo type would let you get more than the max.
- Fixed: Specifying a defaultmap in MAPINFO disabled lax monster activation
  checking instead of deducing it from the game's Hexen/not-Hexen status.
- Fixed: Mirrors were accumulated to the WallMirrors list while viewing the
  automap, so after you turned the map off, a few thousand mirrors could be
  processed, resulting in a noticable delay before the view became visible.
- Added support for using the Teleport_NewMap class of specials with title maps
  so that you can use more than one map as a title map. Using the gametype()
  ACS function will return GAME_TITLE_MAP if the map is being used for a title
  display instead of regular play.
- Added a fourth parameter to ThrustThing to accept a TID of something to
  thrust.
- Fixed: Deactivating an actor mover without activating it first reset its
  target's flags to 0.
- Fixed: Picking up two or more berserk packs only gave the red tinting for
  the first one.
- Fixed: Monsters following a path entered their see state whenever they
  reached a patrol point. I don't know what I was thinking when I did that.
- Fixed: Since pre-2.0.90 demos no longer play back, they should be rejected
  without even trying to play them. Similarly, new demos need to be
  recorded indicating they won't play back with earlier game versions.
  Unfortunately, I didn't bump the demo version between 2.0.63a and 2.0.90, so
  anything pre-2.0.97 won't play with 2.0.97, even though there's probably
  no changes that would cause desynching between 96 and 97. Oh well.
- Fixed DBaseStatusBar::DrBNumber(Outer) to work when some of the big number
  graphics are missing.

January 15, 2005
- Fixed: ACS cos and sin were using signed shifts when calculating the fineangle.

January 13, 2005
- Fixed: Instead of assigning the empty sound a basepriority of -1000,
  S_StartSound() should not even attempt to play it.
- Fixed: FCanvasTextureInfo::Add() did not change the FOV when reassigning an
  existing camera->texture mapping.
- Fixed: SetCameraToTexture did not check if the texture name actually existed as
  a texture. It just assumed it did.

January 10, 2005
- Fixed: P_MorphPlayer() needs to set the player's momx and momy to 0, because
  morphing doesn't maintain the player's momentum.
- Fixed: The Cyberdemon, SpiderMastermind, AlienSpectre*, Crusader, and
  Programmer need MF3_DONTMORPH set. Otherwise, morphing them and killing them
  before they unmorph will skip any of their special death actions. Technically,
  the Inquisitor doesn't need it set, but he's a boss monster, so it seems best
  if he can't be morphed. (For that matter, should any of the mechanical monsters
  in Strife be morphable, since they're not organic?)
- Redid: Invnext and invprev wrap around the inventory list.
- Unmorphing a player now removes the weapon(s) they received in their morphed
  form.
- Redid the dehsupp fix from March 22, 2002.

January 8, 2005
- Fixed: Dead players could still be morphed, at least with the morphme cheat.
  I'm not sure if morph projectiles did it or not, but now they definitely don't.
- Added a call to SN_StopAllSequences() inside S_StopAllChannels(). This
  prevents moving sector sounds from playing during the finale (and any other
  time when sound effects were supposed to have been stopped).
- Fixed: R_DetailDouble() must not do anything when viewactive is false.

January 7, 2005
- Ported the polymost visualization code from Ken's prototype so that I can
  verify the correctness of my C++ port. Which was not quite correct. :-(

January 5, 2005
- Fixed: R_SetupBuffer() calculated ylookup for the height of the screen, and
  not the height of the render target. This meant using camera textures taller
  than the screen would probably crash. But wait! There's more! new_visplane
  must also allocate top and bottom arrays wide enough for any view, not just
  the screen. So I decided to just make it allocate enough for MAXWIDTH.
- Removed some possible unused variable warnings spewed by GCC.
- Fixed: The parser for DEM_SUMMON(FRIEND) tested if type was NULL when it
  should have tested typeinfo instead.
- Changed the actor defaults for GCC to use a function to initialize the
  default actors instead of an initializer list. With newer GCC versions, I
  can no longer count on variables being emitted in the same order they are
  defined, so using an initializer list is impossible. This looks like it adds
  ~300k to the executable, which I suppose isn't too bad.

January 4, 2005
- Changed the object pointer offset lists to not be const when compiling with
  GCC. Some versions and options cause GCC to try to initialize them at
  run-time, even though they are read-only and therefor protected from
  writing.
- Added Makefiles for building with MinGW. Since Chris did the hard part by
  posting a Makefile for the main exe on the forum, I only needed to make
  Makefiles for the auxilliary projects. And then I spent some time porting
  ccdv to Win32, so the make output will look pretty.

January 3, 2005
- Fixed: The self-modifying code in tmap3.nas was still in the .data section
  instead of .rtext, so it couldn't be used with data-execution prevention
  enabled.

January 1, 2005
- Fixed: ParseDecorate() needlessly allocated new TypeInfo objects.
- Fixed: The status bar constructor did not initialize CPlayer. Thus, when
  the Doom status bar's AttachToPlayer method was called it would not do
  the proper face initialization if the status bar was freed and then
  reallocated in the exact same spot. This bug didn't show up in the debug
  build, because the debug CRT automatically fills newly freed and allocated
  memory.
- Fixed: P_SpawnMapThing() does not need a special check for the Lost Soul.

December 24, 2004
- New: Instead of using a static image as a title, you can now use a map.
  Just create it as normal, being sure to do something interesting with
  scripting, and rename it TITLEMAP. It will load just like a normal map,
  but it will behave like a title picture.
- Fixed: The intermission did not compensate for non-4:3 aspect ratios.
- Fixed status bar border for widescreen ratios other than 16:9.
- Corrected clean scaling calculations for widescreens.
- Changed: Giving a BasicArmorBonus now also multiplies the original amount
  by the specified amount instead of just using the specified amount.
- Fixed: When P_SpawnPlayer() transfers a voodoo doll's inventory to the new
  player, it also needs to transfer the InventoryID property so that items
  picked up later won't receive the same ID as an item they already have.
- Fixed: ArtiPoisonBag::BeginPlay() did not call the superclass's version of
  the function.
- Changed A_FireScreamReplace to A_FireScream. Now it plays the sound itself.
  On a related note, moved A_ClericBurnScream to the start of the ClericBoss's
  flaming death and changed the old instance back to A_Scream.
- Fixed: Forgot to delete some old code in AActor::Tick().
- Fixed: The second sidedef-only constructor for DScroller did not set up an
  interpolation.
- Fixed: R_DrawSkyBoxes() initialized the clipping drawseg's siz values to
  1<<31, which is actually INT_MIN, not INT_MAX!
- Fixed: Some properties were not properly transferred when unmorphing an
  actor.
- Fixed: You got HOM around the status bar in widescreen mode if you didn't
  scale the status bar.
- Fixed: You could use the down arrow key to select blank entries on the last
  line in the video mode menu if that line was not full.
- Fixed: The backpack handled pickups for everything after you got one.

December 23, 2004
- Made the bottom of the viewborder visible when the status bar doesn't cover
  the full width of the screen and no border would normally be visible.
- Added SetAmmoCapacity (str typename, int maxamount) and
  GetAmmoCapacity (str typename) ACS commands. Also added the ACS log command.
  It is exactly like printbold, except it prints directly to the console instead
  of the middle of the screen. BTW, ACS has static local variables ala C now.
  They are exactly the same as map variables, except they can only be used in
  the script or function that defines them.
- Fixed some fullscreen pages to work properly with non-4:3 aspect displays.
- Fixed DCanvas::DrawTexture() so that all virtual sizes (not just 320x200wide)
  work with non-4:3 aspect screens. (So long as the virtual size is 4:3.)

December 22, 2004
- Fixed: The backpack was not added to the player's inventory, although there
  was code present to handle removing it from the inventory.
- Loading a BEHAVIOR without any scripts but with other content crashed.
- More revelations with the sprite splitting experiment: Drawsegs are not
  always created when you might think they are. Probably the biggest problem
  is when you look at a line straight-on, so you see the sectors on each side
  of it but not the line itself. I conceded defeat and stuck an #if 0 around
  the related code. If I or someone else want to revisit it later, it's still
  there but inactive. I don't think it's worth the effort to make it work
  properly. A z-buffer would be much easier, more reliable, and possibly even
  quicker when there are a lot of two-sided lines in view. So the solution
  seems obvious: Use hardware acceleration and let it worry about sprite
  clipping. Or stick with the way things are and ignore it. :-) (Community
  Chest 2, MAP15, building number 4 makes a great test-case for this, BTW.)

December 21, 2004
- Messed around with splitting sprites along drawsegs some more. This is far
  from being as straight forward as I had thought. One unexpected problem I
  realized: Most (if not all) of the sprites that stand on the ground are
  actually sunk into the ground, but splitting sprites is not a win unless you
  clip them to the floor and ceiling. So I tried bumping the sprites up so that
  they are aligned with the bottoms of their actor so I could clip them to the
  floor. Now it looks much better. When it works. Unfortunately, there are
  lots of cases that still don't work properly.

December 20, 2004
- Added some code to split sprites along drawsegs.
- Changed the sprite-in-front of drawseg calculations. Now it compares inverse
  Z values in screen space.
- Fixed: The MinotaurFriend targetted friendlies other than itself.
- Fixed: An actor's floorpic was not serialized by name.
- Fixed: Each piece of Hexen armor only gave you one AC.
- Fixed: Morphing a monster didn't copy the original monster's friendliness and
  TID hating to the morphed version.

December 18, 2004
- Fixed: Slideshows in Strife are supposed to change the music to D_SLIDE.
- Fixed: Merchants played their greeting animation in place of their "yes"
  animation. (Or rather, the greeting was played immediately after starting the
  "yes" one, so you only saw the greeting.)
- Fixed: The Strife health bar texture assumed that the vial level would always
  be non-negative. It can go negative if the player dies then cheats to give
  themself health, but not enough for their real health to go positive.
- Fixed: Creating a fade-in-out hudmessage with a fadetime of 0 crashed, because
  it assumed the fade-in time would always be positive.
- Fixed: Instead of calling G_StartTravel(), idclev should set the player's
  health to 0, so the player will do a complete spawn on the new level.
- Fixed: DrBNumberOuter(Font) and DrINumberOuter drew the shadow from one digit
  on top of the next digit.
- Fixed: The Doom HUD drew the selected inventory item on top of the secondary
  ammo if both were present.
- Moved the DrawPowerups() call out of DBaseStatusBar::Draw() and into
  DrawTopStuff(), so the Doom HUD key display won't cover them up
- Fixed: If you started flying and then pressed the land key, you wouldn't be
  able to fly again until the Wings of Wrath wore off. This was done by changing
  several checks for a player with MF2_FLY into checks for a player with
  MF_NOGRAVITY. MF2_FLY just indicates that the player is using the Wings;
  for the player to fly, MF_NOGRAVITY must also be set. If MF_NOGRAVITY is not
  set, but MF2_FLY is, then the pressing +moveup/down reactivates fly mode.
- Changed the receipt of BasicArmorPickup so that the SaveAmount is multiplied
  by the given amount (via the give cheat or ACS giveinventory) in order to make
  it compatible again with earlier versions of ZDoom.
- Fixed: Picking up an armor bonus after using up your armor left you with
  useless armor until you picked up a full-fledged armor item.
- Fixed: Even though voodoo dolls couldn't pick up items, they could still touch
  them without pretending to be a real player and mess things up in the player's
  inventory.
- Fixed: Strife's alien spectres did not execute specials attached to them upon
  death, because they have MF_SPECIAL set.
- Changed the inventory left/light gems (that indicate if you have more items in
  that direction) to blink with gametic instead of level.time, so now they can
  blink while the game is paused.
- Fixed: You could use items while the game was paused.
- I just noticed the fighter's fist doesn't meet the edge of the screen when you
  swing it. What's a good, clean way to handle this situation?
- Brought over the startup log viewer I had added for my Duke port. Unlike my
  Duke port, however, this window is normally hidden and only shows itself when
  a fatal error occurs. Now if something goes wrong during the startup
  sequence, you can review the console log to try and figure out why. I tried
  making it show up at startup as a sort of revival of the way the startup
  process worked once upon a time in DOS land, but too much of the code now
  requires the video to be one of the first things initialized and it just isn't
  practical to rearrange things to make it init later.

December 16, 2004
- New: ZDoom.wad is now managed along with the source code.

December 15, 2004
- Added support for letterboxing, so people without widescreen displays can still
  use widescreen modes without running in a window. Note that if the video card
  enumerates any widescreen displays, then the game will assume they are displayed
  as widescreen, even if they really aren't. Letterbox modes are automatically
  generated from the existing 4:3 modes, but if an existing resolution already has
  the same size, then that resolution won't be available in letterbox form. The
  video modes menu displays LB next to any modes that are letterboxed, so you can
  tell them apart without trying each one.
- Corrected widescreen displays for non-90 degree FOVs.

December 14, 2004
- Added support for 16:10 and (if vid_tft is true) 5:4 displays. Also rearranged
  the video modes menu, removing the depth choice and replacing it with an aspect
  ratio choice.

December 13, 2004
- Rewrote the interpolators to use a hash table instead of a linear array, for
  improved insertion and deletion performance.
- Added interpolation for scrolling floors, ceilings, and walls. Floors especially
  need it, because the lack of interpolation really sticks out when you're being
  carried along by a floor that only moves at 35 FPS.
- Resolutions are now sorted, and you can pick widescreen resolutions if you play
  in a window even if your don't have any fullscreen widescreen modes. (Yep, 16:9
  modes are now supported.)

December 11, 2004
- Decided it's time to bring the goodness of Polymost to ZDoom. Stage 1 complete:
  Convert the clipper to a stand-alone C++ class. Stage 2 to be completed some
  time in the indeterminate future. There's really other things that I should be
  doing right now, ne?

December 9, 2004
- Fixed: APlayerPawn::BestWeapon() did not know about the Tome of Power, so
  when you ran out of sufficient ammo for your tome'd weapon, it could select
  the untome'd version of that weapon, which would turn into the tome'd version
  when it was raised, so you would be stuck in a cycle until the tome ran out or
  you picked a different weapon manually.
- Fixed AMinotaur::Die() should have used a thinker iterator instead of an
  actor iterator to look for minotaurs that are still alive.
- Added Graf's deltaviewheight fix for climbing stairs made of actors.
- Fixed up the pickup ammo amount for the BFG. (Was 100, should be 40.)
- Merged in Jim's ACS character array printing support.

December 6, 2004
- Fixed: Fog boundaries flashed with gunfire. That's wrong because foggy
  sectors don't flash.
- Fixed: Masked textures in a skybox would determine their height from the
  viewz used for the last skybox drawn instead of the viewz for the skybox they
  belong to.
- Fixed: "*fistgrunt" was undefined, so A_FPunchAttack() was unable to play it.
- Fixed: Hexen players did not play their burn death sounds. Neither did the
  cleric boss.
- Fixed: Thingcount should not count items in somebody's inventory.
- Fixed: AInventory::BecomeItem() did not remove the item's TID, so it could
  still be manipulated by scripts even after being picked up.
- Fixed: CheckBossDeath() should consider frozen corpses as not dead, because
  A_BossDeath() is not called until the corpse shatters.
- Changed APlayerPawn::Die() to use P_DropItem() to spawn a new weapon when
  weapondrop is turned on instead of dropping the player's actual weapon.
- Fixed: P_DropItem() needs to clear the MF_NOGRAVITY flag because some Hexen
  items have it set.
- Fixed: ArtiTeleport::Use() called P_UndoPlayerMorph with its player instead of
  its owner's player.

December 4, 2004
- Updated the libraries and moved them out of src and into the base directory.
  Now zlib is at version 1.2.2, libFLAC is version 1.1.1, and src contains only
  the ZDoom-specific files.
- Updated to zlib 1.2.2.

December 3, 2004
- Fixed: 256 entries per column is not enough for dc_tspans. Each column should
  have MAXHEIGHT entries available, because a column that alternates drawn/not-
  drawn pixels each row will need one entry per row.

December 2, 2004
- Fixed playback of SPCs when spc_8bit is true. SNESAPU renders them unsigned,
  but we need them to be signed. Also fixed: Altering spc_stereo and spc_8bit
  while a SPC was playing could crash.
- Added new stuff to the alternate sound renderer: MMX CopyAndClip routine,
  interpolated mixers, FLAC sample loading, streams, and slightly tighter
  inner. So now it's a bit more of a realistic alternative to FMOD. All it
  really lacks is MP3, Vorbis, and MOD support. The snd_interpolate cvar can
  even select between linear (1) and quadratic (2) interpolation, so it can
  sound better than FMOD, which only does linear interpolation.
  
  I'd like to compare the performance of the new code with FMOD, but
  unfortunately, I can't seem to figure out a good way to calculate % CPU used
  by the mixer. My attempts lead to numbers that fluctuate quite a lot for
  relative constant environments. At least it ought to be attractive to the
  Linux folks if it gets modified to support SDL as well as DirectSound, even
  if I have no idea how well it performs.

December 1, 2004
- Reorganized the sound interface code to make it easier to target multiple
  sound renderers.

November 29, 2004
- Added the CTRL-X keypress for clearing the current console command line.
- Changed tab completion to be more Bash-like: When there is more than one
  possible completion, and they all have a common prefix longer than what
  has been typed so far, the full prefix will be filled in for you. (e.g.
  Typing "sn[TAB]" will append "d_" for you because every command that
  starts with "sn" also starts with "snd_".) Note that this only works if
  you have the completion list turned on (con_notablist is false).
- Fixed: Only the first berserk pack you picked up would give you health.
- Fixed: Soul sphere played the wrong pickup sound.

November 25, 2004
- Added render-to-texture support to the engine. Using it requires you do two
  things:
    (1) Define a texture that can be drawn into. You do this with a line in
        ANIMDEFS:

        cameratexture <texture name> <width> <heigth> [fit <width> <height>]

        e.g.

        cameratexture CAMTEX1 64 64
            Creates a texture called CAMTEX1.

        cameratexture CAMTEX2 100 50 fit 80 50
            Creates a texture called CAMTEX2. Its actual dimensions are 100x50,
            but it will be scaled to fit into an area 80x50 units large.

        cameratexture STARTAN2 64 64
            Replaces the existing texture STARTAN2 with a new one that can be
            rendered into. Since no fit size was provided, this new texture will
            be sized to occupy the same space as the old STARTAN2 texture, which
            is 128x128.

        cameratexture STARTAN2 64 64 fit 64 64
            Replaces the existing texture STARTAN2, but leaves the texture
            unscaled by specifying a fit size that matches the real size.

        Square textures use less memory than non-square textures. However, if
        you want to use a camera that can see the texture it renders into, you
        should use a non-square texture.

    (2) Use ACS to identify which camera renders to the texture:
    
        SetCameraToTexture (<camera tid>, <texture name>, <FOV>);
        
        e.g.
        
        SetCameraToTexture (100, "CAMTEX1", 90);

November 24, 2004
- Expanded the definition of local for such things as "localambientsound" so
  that players will still hear the sound if they are looking through a camera.
- Added the summonfriend command.
- Made P_RandomChaseDir() truely random. The only real randomness it had before
  was in deciding whether monsters preferred to go east or southeast.

November 20, 2004
- Fixed: AInventory::BecomeItem() must remove the actor from all the touching
  sector lists. Otherwise, you can get crashes if a floor or ceiling in a
  sector touching the item moves later.
- Fixed: Patrols only went to the first goal and then got stuck.
- Fixed: Recurssion when an unloading script tries to change to a different
  map. The map change is already under way, so the script cannot start another
  map change.
- Moved BasicArmor's PostBeginPlay icon fixing into Tick, so it can cope with
  the "give armor" cheat removing the icon when the player already has armor.

November 18, 2004
- New ACS stuff:
    bool playeringame (int playernumber);
        Returns true if the player [0..7] is in the game and false if not.

    bool playerisbot (int playernumber);
        Returns true if the player [0..7] is a bot and false if not.

    script <x> unloading
    {
        ...
    }
        Executed by the level just before it unloads because the players are
        about to move to another one. Everything up until the first latent
        function will have a chance to execute. If the script needs to wait,
        it will continue execution when the players return to the map. Since
        this type of script is executed with the equivalent of ACS_Execute
        and not ACS_ExecuteAlways, it can block itself from executing the
        next time the level is unloaded if it hasn't finished with its
        business yet.
        
    script <x> (int playernumber) disconnect
    {
        ...
    }
        This type of script is executed when a player disconnects in a
        multiplayer game (including bots). THIS SCRIPT IS EXECUTED BY THE
        WORLD, NOT BY THE PLAYER WHO LEFT. By the time the script is run,
        the player is already gone, so you can't do anything to that player.
        The number of the player who left is passed as the only argument to
        this script.
- Selecting a conversation choice that stays at the same dialogue node no
  longer moves the current selection.
- Added a gold display when talking to merchants.
- Fixed: Poison bolts shouldn't kill merchants.
- Fixed: An ActorMover didn't prevent the renderer from interpolating the
  actor when it was moved onto the path to start off.
- Fixed: AInterpolationPoint::ScanForLoop() got stuck if the path looped, but
  the initial point wasn't part of the loop.
- Fixed: Giving an interpolation point the ambush flag in an editor would
  cause it to not join a path.
- Added Graf Zahl's fix for shootable walls with invalid sector tags that
  some wads use to make things you can break. Also added a parameter to the
  GlassBreak special that you can set to 1 if you don't want it to throw out
  any shards.
- Fixed: MF3_NOTARGET should only be respected my monsters of the same
  friendliness.
- Fixed: D'Sparil and the Heresiarch always summoned hostile helpers even if
  they were friendly.
- Fixed: DCajunMaster::ThinkForMove() needed more NULL checks for the
  player's ready weapon.
- Fixed: When using the Tome of Power, only the first weapon in a slot could
  be selected with the slot command, because FWeaponSlot::PickWeapon() didn't
  consider the powered-up version as a match for the current weapon.
- Fixed: If a player is telefragged and drops a weapon (or anything else), it
  can mess up the floor/ceiling determination in P_TeleportMove() thanks to
  the heavy reliance on global variables in the physics code. Those make it
  very much non-reentrant.
- Fixed: Monsters did not activate player-cross lines when strict checking
  was turned off.
- Fixed divide by 0 in the Hexen status bar's DrawKeyBar() method when the
  armor slot increments are 0.
- Changed the ACS random command so you can specify the max and min as either
  parameter. This fixes a divide by 0 when the maximum is one less than the
  minimum (because now the maximum cannot be less than the minimum).
- Fixed PROP_FLY with SetPlayerProperty.
- Removed MF_NOBLOCKMAP from IceChunk, IceChunkHead, the Heretic imp chunks,
  Meat, and Junk.
- Removed LEVELINFO_START_TIME, since it's useless outside of timedemo.
- Fixed log HUD messages (and print statements) were logged to the console but
  not to the log file.
- Fixed scrolling bounds when automap rotation is on and follow is off. Issues
  remaining: The grid in rotation mode only works well if follow is on, and 
  rotation is relative to the player rather than the center of the screen. I'm
  tempted to just rewrite the whole map package to be more rotation friendly
  (and be more modular so there could be multiple instances on the HUD, as was
  requested a couple of times in the past).

November 17, 2004
- Corrected movement of the automap background when map rotate and follow are
  turned on.

November 16, 2004
- Separated the drawing of HUD messages from the main status bar pass. Now HUD
  messages that are meant to be drawn on top of the status bar are drawn on top
  of the status bar.

November 13, 2004
- Fixed: Dehacked's PatchThing() needs to translate the old damage type flags to
  the new damage type value.
- Changed AActor::Die() so it doesn't reset the target if the source is NULL.
- Changed A_CustomBulletAttack() and A_BulletAttack() back to getting their damage
  type from the puff, like they (indirectly) did before.
- Added division/modulus by zero checks to all the PCD_DIV/MOD* p-codes.
- New SNDINFO command to deal with several Strife sounds: $singular <sound name>.
  Use this, and only one copy of the sound will play *anywhere*. This is different
  from $limit, which is distance based and can stop currently playing sounds. There
  are actually a lot of singular sounds in Strife. I only chose to make a few of
  them singular, in particular the alarm. TBD: Should new singular sounds cut off
  an already playing copy or not play at all?
- Klaxon tweaks: Now klaxons clear off the LastHeard property using the same
  recursion that sets it (with P_NoiseAlert).
- Fixed: G_DoReborn() could only fake as players 5-8 when playing Doom or Heretic.
- Fixed: P_SpawnMapThing() calculated the player number wrong for player starts > 4.
- Fixed: AWeapon::AttachToOwner() did not call the status bar's
  ReceivedWeapon method.
- Fixed: Even though I fixed the A_CallSpecial parsing, I broke its handling.

November 5, 2004
- Corrected the pickup sounds for Strife items.
- Added the MF3_NORADIUSDMG flag to the Inquisitor so he won't kill
  himself so readily.
- Fixed: Armorer hair color was wrong. (Cyan instead of gray.)
- Fixed: Starting the game from a fullscreen console with fullscreen false
  prevented anything from being drawn, becaues the primary surface would be
  lost by the time DDrawFB::PaintToWindow() was reached.

November 4, 2004
- Fixed: The C span drawers all drew 64x64 textures in row-major order
  instead of column-major order. (They were correct for other sizes, though.)
- Changed the Oracle's spectre (#3) to have MF_SPAWNCEILING and not bob in
  its spawn states. Now it behaves more like the Strife original despite
  being defined even less like it.
- Increased the opacity of alien spectres to 66%.
- Fixed: A_ExplodeParms() checked against the size of AttackList instead
  of ExplodeList, and it had the distance and damage type parameters to
  P_RadiusAttack() swapped.
- Fixed player morphing crashing when using the morphme command in a game
  that doesn't normally have morphed players.
- Made the Strife burning player more correct: You can run around for a bit
  before collapsing, and then you stop flailing your arms around.
- Fixed: I forgot to change the prototype for the Soulsphere's Use function,
  so it did nothing.
- Fixed: The AFourthWeaponPiece class destroyed the fourth weapon after giving
  it to you if weapon stay was off.
- Fixed: Picking up a torch or light amp while invulnerable cancelled out
  the special colormap for the invulnerability effect.
- Fixed: In Doom, you didn't raise your weapon at the start of a new game if
  you had neverswitchonpickup on.
- Added the ChangeSky ACS command so that I can remedy another slight Strife
  problem: The sky on all maps should become gloomy after killing the
  Programmer.
- Fixed: The post-closing Strife slideshow music should be D_FAST, not D_INTRO.
- Fixed: The opening Strife slideshow is supposed to play D_INTRO, not D_DARKER.
- Changed Ceiling_LowerAndCrush so that it uses the same speed for down and
  "up", so crushers that stay down can slow down when they hit something. Fixes
  the Templar crushers on Strife MAP12.
- Fixed: In Strife, crushing ceilings that don't go back up are supposed to
  go to the floor.
- Fixed: Strife linetype 180 didn't copy the sector properties.
- Fixed: Strife instant death sectors were not implemented for the player, and
  the damage done by sector type 4 (strobe and hurt) was wrong.

November 3, 2004
- Fixed: Talking to friendly PCs made them hate you.
- Fixed: When P_SpawnPlayer() moved a voodoo doll's inventory to the new
  player, it didn't fix the items' Owner links.
- Fixed: AAmmo::HandlePickup() didn't check for a NULL ReadyWeapon when
  picking up ammo that you had previously run out of.
- Fixed: New check in PlayerLandedOnThing() prevents both *grunt and *land
  from being played if they are defined as the same sound.
- Fixed: The minimum velocity P_ZMovement() checks against to decide if your
  view should be squatted should not vary with gravity. Same for grunting in
  PlayerLandedOnThing().
- Fixed: The Archvile and Boss Brain did not transfer their friendliness.
- Fixed: Animated door Open/CloseSounds were left uninitialized if the
  definition didn't specify them.
- Fixed: AMageStaffFX2::SpecialMissileHit() did the wrong damage type.
- Fixed: Forgot to change the prototype for the Megasphere's Use function.

November 2, 2004
- Added HUDMSG_FADEINOUT style HUD messages.
- Added the GetLevelInfo ACS command, which can be used to collect information
  before jumping to an intermission-style map.
- Added support for loading 1, 2, and 4 bit PNG images.
- Merged in Graf Zahl's customizable animated doors submission.
- Added the sound effect for Strife's mask powerup.
- Reimplemented water-breathing with the iron feet.
- Fixed: Closing doors made frozen corpses disappear instead of shatter.
- Added fire and disintegration deaths for the Strife player.
- Removed MF2_ICEDAMAGE, MF2_FIREDAMAGE, and GetMod() from AActor in favor of
  a DamageType property.
- Fixed: Masked textures visible through multiple skyboxes would be rendered
  multiple times.
- Fixed: Skybox planes were drawn in front of any masked textures behind them.
- Fixed: Strife's armor is auto-activated when you pick it up only if you don't
  already have some in your inventory.
- Fixed: The ACS ClearInventory command should leave undroppable items in place,
  but there is a special exception to zero out the armor slots for a HexenArmor
  item, which is almost the same as removing it.

November 1, 2004
- Fixed: ArtiBoostArmor didn't work in Hexen.
- Fixed: Hexen players need to start with HexenArmor in their inventory, or else
  they won't get their class-specific armor bonuses until they pick up other armor.
  Since each player must start with HexenArmor, that means I can make a fifth slot
  to hold their class armor and get rid of GetAutoArmorSave(), GetArmorMax(),
  and GetArmorIncrement() and make the armor handling somewhat more homogenous.
- Disabled left-right aiming when autoaim is 0.
- Added support for the newer version of the Strife Teaser that everybody but
  me seems to have downloaded.
- Changed rail handling to be closer to Strife's: If you approach the rail from
  the low side, you can jump "into" the railing. This is still better than
  Strife's approach, which lets you jump into rails from either side. It's needed
  to get out of an area on MAP04, and possible others as well. Unfortunately, it's
  really ugly behavior and will probably be reported as a bug by somebody who
  doesn't know why he got stuck in a rail.
- Fixed: P_ChangeSwitchTexture() did not set a value for *quest if no switch
  textures were found on the sidedef, so you could get random stat increases in
  Strife by breaking two-sided glass lines if only one side of the line had a
  "switch" texture.
- Improved the wandering behavior of friendly monsters. Now they use the actual
  chase states instead of the look states, so they animate naturally.
- Fixed: P_RandomChaseDir() thought angles were sorted in the wrong order, so it
  never picked a random chase direction.
- Fixed: I forgot to flag the DoomPlayer as friendly.
- Added the friendly flag for use in DECORATE.
- Fixed: AWeapon::CreateTossable() let you drop sister weapons independantly from
  each other. It should only create a tossable version of the primary weapon and
  make the other one go "poof."
- Fixed: Shadow Armor used the same invisibility powerup as Doom. It should be
  a separate one, because Strife doesn't have the fuzz effect.
- Fixed: Strife uses a LINEHEIGHT of 19 for its menus, not 16 like Doom. There are
  also a few other positional differences between the menus.
- ZDoom now offers the exact same translation tables as Strife, which change the
  colors for more than just the player's suit.
- Changed P_RadiusAttack() so that anything that does fire damage does not thrust
  the thing it hurts vertically. This fixes the phosphorous grenades' fire.
- Fixed: The Strife grenades should have MF3_CANBOUNCEWATER set so they can bounce
  off liquid flats. They're not like Heretic bouncers in this respect.
- Fixed: Strife liquid flats *do* clip sprites ala Heretic/Hexen. I did not
  know that. That means the StickInWater also needs to have MF2_FLOORCLIP set.
  That also explains why WaterfallSplash doesn't show up in Strife.
- Fixed: StrifePuff should use the same actor-hit animation as StrifeSpark. They
  only differ by their non-actor-hit animations.
- Fixed: The surgery kit ought to give you full health, not 100 health.
- Fixed: Flying mini-missiles used the wrong states from StrifePuff.
- Fixed: G_PlayerReborn() only gives the default inventory to the first copy of a
  player in a level, which means a voodoo doll can get the inventory, while the
  real player gets nothing. P_SpawnPlayer() must check if the player already had
  an actor spawned for it and if so, transfer the old actor's inventory to the new
  actor.
- Fixed: R_InitFuzzTable() is the wrong place to initialize fuzzviewheight.
- Fixed: The "give armor" cheat gave you the wrong armor.
- Fixed: The Dehacked ammo parser didn't calculate new BackpackAmount and
  BackpackMaxAmount values.
- Fixed: A_CheckReload() still had AltFire and PrimaryFire swapped.
- Fixed: The NULL weapon check in P_CheckWeaponFire() was in the wrong spot.
- Fixed: The give cheat gave you X number of item instances instead of just setting
  the item's Amount field. The same goes for ACS's GiveInventory command.

October 30, 2004
- Fixed: G_StartTravel() should only affect living players. Otherwise, the body of a
  dead player will replace the live body that was spawned on the new level and the
  player will stay dead.
- Fixed: Strife line type 188 needs to be repeatable so you can cross over it without
  QuestItem16 and then cross over it again later with the item for it to have effect.
  This opens the door to the castle.

October 29, 2004
- Fixed: The idclev cheat needs to call G_StartTravel().
- Added a BackpackAmount and BackpackMaxAmount to the Ammo definition, so the amount of
  ammo received with a backpack can differ from the amount picked up from a base ammo
  item, and so the max amount can be configured too.
- Fixed: If you already had enough of something a merchant tried to give you, you would
  get both the "enough" response and the affirmative response.
- Fixed: The Sigil was draining armor and not just health.
- Fixed: The Oracle's spectre wouldn't immediately chase after you if you killed the
  Oracle with a dagger, and it wouldn't aggressively attack until you attacked it.
- Fixed: Strife floater blocking lines were not properly translated.
- AActor::DropInventory() now clears the MF_NOGRAVITY flag, since several Hexen items
  had the flag set.
- Fixed: Not coop/deathmatch thing flags in BOOM maps did not work. MBF's friendly flag
  wasn't handled either.

October 28, 2004
- Fixed: The player's inventory was wiped out when switching levels in deathmatch. The
  player needs to be reborn every time they are spawned in a deathmatch game so that
  they can get the default inventory.
- Fixed: P_ThingProjectile() should set the spawned thing's speed only if it is truely
  a missile.
- Fixed: FindMostRecentWeapon() failed if a tome-ed weapon was ready.
- Fixed: AInventory::GoAway() returned false for items that should stay.
- Fixed: The flags for maplinedef2_t were signed. They were correctly unsigned for
  maplinedef_t.
- Fixed: Ripper didn't set its death state.
- Fixed: GoldWandPuff2 should inherit from GoldWandFX1, not GoldWandPuff1.
- Fixed: AWeapon::CheckAmmo() thought you had enough ammo to use a weapon's alternate
  fire mode if it didn't have an alternate fire. Hence, you could e.g. select the poison
  crossbow right after receiving Strife's crossbow, even if you didn't have any poison
  bolts.
- Fixed: The StrifePuff had the hit actor and hit wall states swapped.
- Fixed: APigPlayer::ActivateMorphWeapon() didn't check if you already had a snout.
- Fixed: The +moveup and +movedown keys only worked under water.
- Fixed: G_FinishTravel() needs to check for NULL duplicate players, which can happen if
  a start spot doesn't exist for the player on the new map.
- Fixed: Puzzle items did not define their own use sound.
- Fixed: Most of the Doom powerups were stackable.
- Fixed: The fuzzy column drawer did not correctly clip the bottom of the posts to the
  screen bottom of y-doubling was turned on.
- Fixed: The chainsaw's UpSound was mis-spelled as "weapos/sawup".
- Fixed: FindMostRecentWeapon() called P_SetPsprite to drop the old PendingWeapon.
  But since it was a PendingWeapon, this meant it wasn't actually visible, so doing so
  would change the weapon sprite. Worse, this function is only processed locally, so
  it could mess up multiplayer and demos. Now A_Raise() checks for a pending weapon and
  starts the current one dropping if it finds one.
- Added a NULL name check to FFont::FindFont() and FWadCollection::CheckNumForName() to
  fix Daedalus crashing immediately. To fix it for real, the FBehavior constructor needs
  to call UnencryptStrings() before calling FindLanguage(). Otherwise, none of the
  strings are available.
- Fixed: Weapons you dropped magically had ammo, so you could cheat by dropping your
  weapon and then picking it back up to give yourself more ammo.
- Fixed: DCanvas::DrawTexture() called NetUpdate() when a menu was open. This is bad
  because it can cause menu keypresses to be processed during the menu's drawer
  function. Specifically, the case that brought the badness of this to my attention
  was the Strife conversation menu. If a choice was made while the menu was being drawn,
  it would alter the data used for drawing the menu, and it could crash. This is probably
  also why the screenshot in the load menu would sometimes disappear after selecting a
  game.

October 27, 2004
- Fixed: AM_drawThings() drew bounding boxes in the wrong locations if am_rotate
  was false.
- Did some miscellaneous GCC 3.4 cleanup.
- Moved the project files out of the src directory and into the base directory.

October 26, 2004
- Fixed: AHealth should have a default MaxAmount of 0, not 100, so it maxes out at
  whatever the player's current max health is.
- Fixed: Using Dehacked to make an ammo-less weapon use ammo left the AmmoUse1
  property at 0.
- Fixed: A_CallSpecial() parsing was broken.
- Fixed: The peasants are not all the same speed.
- Fixed: A_AcolyteDie() was incomplete.
- Fixed: Light green and blue acolytes are supposed to have 60 health, not 70.
- Fixed: Changing Dehacked MaxArmor did not update ArmorBonus. Changing Dehacked
  MaxSoulsphere did not update HealthBonus.

October 25, 2004
- Fixed: A_KlaxonBlare() used threshold when it should have used reactiontime.
- Fixed: The KlaxonWarningLight from Strife should not have its initial tic randomized,
  so all the klaxons in a level can stay synchronized.
- Fixed: A_ItBurnsItBurns() didn't set the death sound to the burning death sound.
- Fixed: The "peasant/death" sound no longer links to all three death sounds, just the
  first one, because that's the only one Strife actually played.
- Fixed: AActor::DropInventory() needs to call P_TryMove() on the dropped item, or
  sector information might not be filled out correctly.
- Fixed: After changing item dropping to start the item out as not-pickup-able,
  A_Beacon() was no longer able to clear the MF_SPECIAL flag, because AInventory::Tick()
  would set it again. A_Beacon() needs to set DropTime to 0 as well.
- Fixed: The final frame for ExplosiveBarrel2 was fullbright.
- Fixed: If a powerup was blinking and you used an item to restore it, APowerup::
  HandlePickup() would restore the powerup without actually using the item.
- Fixed: AInventory::Tick() and AInventory::CreateTossable() now handle solid items
  (specifically, the Degnin ore).
- Fixed: ASigil::SpecialDropAction() now gives a Sigil piece to every player in the
  game. Previously, it tried giving it only to whoever the Sigil dropper was
  targetting. If the monster was killed quickly enough, it was possible for it to
  be targetting nothing at all. And there was also the possibility for it to be
  targetting a non-player.
- Added a NULL player check to AWeapon::AttachToOwner().
- Added IF_ALWAYSPICKUP for auto-activated items that you can have a maximum of 0 of
  (such as the armor bonus), so you can take them off the map even if you don't really
  need them. AHealth::TryPickup() also uses it for the Doom health bonuses.
- Fixed: Doom HUD crashed when trying to draw an inventory item without a valid icon.
- Fixed: ArtiBoostArmor tried to give the player BasicArmor instead of a
  BasicArmorBonus when not playing Hexen.
- Fixed: A_FireCGun() could crash if the weapon's state was before the first
  attack state.
- Fixed: Monsters always activated player-cross lines.
- Changed ArtiInvisibility to give you the newly added PowerGhost instead of
  PowerInvisibility. Now you can use both types of invisibility without being
  restricted by whether or not you are playing Heretic.
- Fixed: I forgot to make PowerupGiver's EffectTics do anything. Also added
  BlendColor to PowerupGiver at Graf's suggestion.
- Fixed: I forgot to add IF_PICKUPFLASH for the Speed Boots and Tome of Power.
- Changed P_DamageMobj() so that spectral entities are subject to non-spectral
  damage if the damage amount is one million or more. This lets P_Massacre()
  kill them.
- Fixed mobj_statenames[] array in thingdef.cpp
- Fixed: I forgot to add a case for ADEF_MinMissileChance in infodefaults.cpp.

October 21, 2004
- 2.0.91 time, just so people stop posting the same crash log.
- Added a pickup delay after dropping, but it still seems to be problematic.
- Fixed: Classic BEHAVIOR lumps weren't having their scripts sorted.
- Fixed: P_TestActivateLine() always returned false for SPAC_MCROSS lines if the
  ML_MONSTERSCANACTIVATE line was not set.
- Fixed: A_Wander() now clears the MF4_INCOMBAT flag, so you can talk to peasants
  after fighting in their vicinity. Strife does not clear this flag there, nor do
  I know if it ever cleared it anywhere.
- Fixed: AInventory::GoAwayAndDie() left the MF_SPECIAL flag set, so it was possible
  for a player to try to pick up the item in the next tic before it destroyed itself.
- Fixed: AHealthTraining::TryPickup() ignored its superclass's return value.
- Fixed: Intermission screen tried to show post-E3 maps in Heretic.
- Fixed: Now that FWadCollection::FindLump() ignores lumps outside the global
  namespace, skins couldn't be loaded.
- Fixed: PROP_Weapon_YAdjust used an unsigned byte, so negative yadjusts didn't work.
- Changed the size boxes around actors in map cheat view into a real feature instead
  of something I quickly threw in for debugging. It's now accessed with am_cheat 3
  and works properly with rotating maps.
- Fixed: FActorInfo::BuildDefaults() checked ADEF_SkipSuper as a byte instead of
  a word.
- Fixed: The artifact flash was not cleared from the Raven status bars when the
  last item was used.
- Fixed: A_CustomBulletAttack tried to use A_CustomMissile instead.
- Fixed: New flag4 names in thingdef.cpp.
- Fixed: Cyberdemon was MF4_LONGMELEERANGE instead of MF4_MISSILEMORE.
- Fixed: Fullscreen inventory bar positions were wrong in Doom.
- Fixed: Hexen armor was quite broken.
- Fixed: S_StartSound() no longer tries to play sound ids below 0.
- Fixed: Terrain splash sounds were initialized to -1 instead of 0.

October 20, 2004
- Time to release 2.0.90, I think?
- Added some Strife keys to the controls menu.
- Did more work on the Strife status bar. I think it's feature complete now.
- Finished reimplementing the Heretic status bar.
- Made cholycount, mstaffcount, and flamecount local to the weapons that use them
  instead of the players who fire them. The rain1 and rain2 members are now stored
  in the shooter's inventory instead, so it should be safe to use the rain with
  monsters.

October 19, 2004
- Added extrapolation for the Strife popscreen scrolling.

October 14, 2004
- Fixed: Using -warp with an ExMy game and only providing the map number only worked
  if -warp wasn't the last parameter on the command line.
- Updated some powerup-related code for the new inventory system.

October 12, 2004
- Fixed: Quitting a game and returning to the title screen would not zero the
  palette blend.
- Fixed: Missiles disappearing on horizon lines were still exploded.

October 8, 2004
- Added a scrolling effect for switching between pages in the keys pop screen.

October 6, 2004
- Fixed: Missiles with MF2_BOUNCE2 set did no normal damage.
- Added particle blood for the Heretic/Hexen blood functions.
- Added a fix for negative row offsets to non-power of 2 height textures.
- Continued my R_FakeFlat() fix from yesterday: It didn't copy the control sector's
  lighting either.
- LEVEL_SWAPSKIES is now ignored if LEVEL_DOUBLESKY is set.
- Fixed a possible crash in SC_GetString() if whitespace is the last character(s)
  in a script.
- Fixed the sliding along diagonal walls behavior in P_HitSlideLine() so that it
  uses correct math. (from code submitted on the forum)

October 5, 2004
- Removed MF_NOBLOCKMAP from ColonGibs, SmallBloodPool, BrainStem, and BloodPool. I
  can't see any good reason for them to have this flag set.
- Fixed: player_t::Serialize() set PendingWeapon to WP_NOCHANGE. I have no idea why.
- Added a playing of "minotaur/attack3" to A_MinotaurAtk3().
- Fixed: R_FakeFlat() did not set FakeSide to FAKED_BelowFloor when viewing a
  fake plane with SECF_CLIPFAKEPLANES and SECF_FAKEFLOORONLY set and the fake floor
  was above the real ceiling.
- Fixed: DArgs::GatherFiles() would hang on files with unexpected extensions.
- Autostarting games (i.e. co-op) of Hexen now use the map set as the first map,
  so you can play co-op Deathkings without knowing Deathkings starts on MAP41.
- Added range checks to C_DoKey(), C_ChangeBinding(), and C_GetBinding().
- Fixed integer overflow in P_SetSlope() for very extreme slopes.
- Stopped outputting the exception information to the crash log for an
  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION when run under a pre-NT kernel, because those seem to
  fill it with 0xFF instead of anything meaningful.

October 4, 2004
- Fixed: The mace death ball did full damage to teammates.
- Fixed: The font translation builders counted the transparent color as a visible
  color and erroneously included it in the calculations, making every range lighter
  than they should have been.
- Fixed: Giving the player a weapon when they were not already using one would not
  bring the weapon up. (Note: Not bringing the new weapon up if the player is
  already using a weapon is normal behavior.)
- Fixed: PickNextWeapon() and PickPrevWeapon() crashed when the player had no
  ready weapon.
- Changed MakeKey to return a value of 0xFFFFFFFF for NULL strings.
- Changed the centerview command to send a DEM_CENTERVIEW event instead of using the
  ticcmd_t structure to do it. Now it works while the game is paused.
- Changed particle visibility calculations so they use r_SpriteVisibility instead of
  a separate variable pre-multiplied by 2. So now there is no r_ParticleVisibility
  to overflow.
- Removed the 3-digit restriction on large fullscreen HUD numbers.
- Fixed: G_LoadGame() did not check for a NULL name.
- Added the -nojoy command line parameter to disable the enumeration of joysticks,
  effectively disabling joysticks regardless of the use_joystick cvar.
- Reduced the maximum FOV from 175 to 170.
- New: With the (non-overlayed) automap on, a cut-down rendering process is performed
  so that the automap can update while you move around.
- Fixed the switch and animation parsers so they can use overridden textures.
- Changed the warp command so that it gets sent across the loopback device.
- Changed the default item respawning behavior so that the dmflag is observed in all
  multiplayer games, not just deathmatch.
- Fixed: Thing_Projectile did not set the projectile's speed.
- Fixed: The banishment device did not work on non-monsters. Normally, that's okay,
  but it didn't work on players either.
- Fixed: Ambient sounds in Doom-format maps could prevent players from spawning.
- Fixed: The scripted version of Scroll_Texture_Both now checks to make sure the
  specified line side is valid.
- After P_SetupLevel() calls P_LoadThings(), it now sets the healths of the players
  to match their actors, in case their voodoo dolls were were fragged during the
  spawn process. (Plutonia MAP06)
- FindShortestTextureAround() and FindShortestUpperAround() now return the height of
  the null texture if none of the sector's side have a corresponding texture.
- Changed the minotaur drops so that (1) Minotaur always drops and (2) MinotaurFriend
  never drops.
- Added a dummy actor with doomednum 32000, so Doom Builder's camera won't show up
  in maps.
- Added a minimum screen size of 320x200 to the Win32Video mode enumerator.

September 29, 2004
- Removed the bStaticName texture flag.
- Added support for autoactivating items with a MaxAmount of 0. This lets me use the
  same armor classes for Strife (which can stack armor) and Doom/Heretic (which cannot
  stack).

September 28, 2004
- Merged in my the old Linux changes I made just after releasing 2.0.63.

September 7, 2004
- Stopped "*** SOUND DEBUG INFO ***"'s flashing.
- Changed the default resolution from 320x200 to 640x480.
- Added some sound precaching now. Sounds that are stored in an Actor's members
  are now loaded at level load time, and those that aren't are unloaded. Is this
  enough or should I also scan scripts for strings that could be sounds?
- Fixed a bug I added when I fixed the palette scrambling just after switching to
  fullscreen mode. The WM_PALETTECHANGED message could be received during a drawing
  operation, but it was still handled immediately anyway. So after doing that, the
  screen would no longer be locked, and drawing operations would be referencing a
  NULL pointer. Now the reosurce freeing and restoring waits until the next Lock call.

August 31, 2004
- Fixed: The vampiric mode of the serpent staff brought you down to 100 health if you
  were over it.

August 25, 2004
- Fixed: PIT_CeilingRaise would move overlapping things that did not have MF2_PASSMOBJ
  set.
- Fixed: Selecting an episode not present in the shareware Heretic told you you needed
  to buy Doom.
- Fixed: PTR_UseTraverse didn't consider ML_BLOCKEVERYTHING lines to be blocking.
- Fixed: PTR_AimTraverse didn't consider ML_BLOCKEVERYTHING lines to be blocking.
- Fixed: After pressing +use to load a save game after you die, +use would still be
  down after the load finished, and you could open doors immediately. Nasty if there
  was some mean thing behind the door all set to kill you.
- Fixed: Sector special transferring moving floors also copied a sector's secret flag.
- Changed the player setup menu to use the arrow cursor instead of the skull cursor.
- Changed FWarpTexture::MakeTexture() to allocate a temporary buffer instead of using
  a fixed sized 256-byte one.
- Changed sprite flipping so it flips the sprite's left offset too.
- Fixed: You could use items on the intermission screens between levels.
- Changed the ACS thingsound command to use CHAN_AUTO like the other ACS functions.
- Fixed: Flying things could get stuck inside rising floors.

August 14, 2004
- Fixed sign problms with door light tags.
- Fixed: PIT_CheckOnmobjZ()'s "under thing" check used < instead of <=. This
  is why falling stacks of monsters would get stuck and be unable to move.

August 10, 2004
- Added support for drawing masked and translucent flats that are part of
  a stack. The amount of translucency is controlled by the first argument
  of the 9077 and 9078 things. At the moment, this is only for unsloped flats.

July 29, 2004
- Added checks in AAmbientSound::(De)Activate so that you can't activate it
  when it's already activated or deactivate it when it's already deactivated.
- Fixed: addmenukey did not ensure that the ControlsMenu.items pointed to the
  first entry of CustomControlsItems, so if you added too many controls and the
  array needed to resize, the ControlsMenu would no longer point to valid data.
- Did some fullscreen palette work now that I somehow ended up with a program
  that _always_ blows up my palette within a second of switching to fullscreen
  mode. Now when the game receives WM_PALETTECHANGED messages from other windows
  while it's fullscreen, it immediately queues up a palette update event to
  undo what the other window did. Other programs shouldn't be messing with
  the palette when they don't even have the focus, but this obviously doesn't
  stop them from doing it anyway. :-( Hopefully, this makes vid_palettehack
  obsolete. Also added vid_showpalette cvar to draw the palette to the screen
  for debugging purposes. Thanks to that, I can see that the first and last 10
  colors are being kept at the standard system palette colors after some other
  program alters the palette in fullscreen mode, and no amount of
  IDirectDrawPalette::SetEntries() calls will change them. I need to release
  and recreate my surfaces and palette, or I won't be able to touch them.
- Added separate rgamma, ggamma, and bgamma cvars to control the gamma of
  individual color components in fullscreen mode. These are multiplied to
  with the gamma cvar, so that cvar still controls the overall gamma. I need
  this because my monitor is extra green, and the drivers don't gamma adjust
  paletted displays for me.

July 28, 2004
- Stopped using FSOUND_Sample_Upload for everything. It seems to be even more
  broken with the latest FMOD.

July 26, 2004
- Added a NULL pointer check to the main P_TraceBleed function that takes a
  target, because D-ONAHD can cause this to happen some times when the imps
  shoot their BFGs in A_BFGSpray. So linetarget also gets copied to a local
  variable before being used in A_BFGSpray, since P_DamageMobj apparently can
  change it.
- Updated the FakePickup and DehackedPickup classes so that they work with the
  new inventory system.
- Added coop starts 5-8 for Strife because they're on the Bishop's Tower map
  for some reason.
- Finally added the special deathmatch logic for the enemy-finding used by
  rebels spawned from a teleporter beacon.

July 22, 2004
- Fixed the default Heretic MAPINFO: The episode 5 maps are supposed to play the
  music from episode 2 (not 1), and the episode 6 maps didn't have any music at
  all.
- Fixed: The Heretic ambient sounds were off by one.
- Changed the default for opl_freqeuncy to 49716, since that's the rate the
  chip actually played at in SoundBlaster/AdLib cards, and the emulator performs
  very poorly when it needs to downsample. Also added new OPL frequencies to
  choose from in the menu.
- Fixed: OPLmusicBlock::ServiceStream could crash on non-looping songs, because
  the return value FALSE was never passed along to tell FMOD to stop the stream.

July 19, 2004
- Changed DDrawFB::LockSurf so that a result of DDERR_UNSUPPORTEDMODE when
  trying to recreate a surface is non-fatal. The game should now be able to
  survive a screen saver and power suspend.
- Reimplemented the key display on Doom's status bar.

July 16, 2004
- Reimplemented the Hexen status bar's key bar. Also improved the status bar so
  that it can show ammo from other games.
- Fixed the ammo and key displays for Heretic's status bar. Plus, now Heretic's
  status bar will properly update when you lose a key, which it didn't before.
- Reimplemented the invulnerability powerup.

July 15, 2004
- Fixed: Morphing a monster and then using the kill monsters cheat would crash
  because the original unmorphed version would be destroyed, then when the
  morphed one died, it tried to destroy the original again, because the
  pointer hadn't been set NULL yet. Since the actual crash is from unlinking the
  actor twice, AActor::Destroy() now sets MF_NOSECTOR and MF_NOBLOCKMAP after
  unlinking an actor.
- Fixed: Trying to use "-" as a sky with MBF's 271/272 linetypes crashed. Now
  it ignores the control line and just draws a normal sky.
- Fixed: G_DoReborn() needs to do a complete new game, not just a reload of the
  current map, if the player is dead and wants to respawn without a most recent
  save.
- Changed FWadCollection::FindLump() so that it only returns lumps that are in
  the global namespace. Now it won't return lumps that got moved into a skin
  namespace. On a related note, FWadCollection::SkinHack() now prints a warning
  when it thinks it finds a skin wad with maps in it.
- Fixed: The "you are here" marks on Heretic's inter-level maps were no longer
  drawn.
- Updated to FMOD 3.73.

July 14, 2004
- Moved the full-screen HUD coordinate logic out of DBaseStatusBar and into
  DCanvas::DrawTexture. This is so that powerups can draw their status icons
  themselves without needing to hook into the status bar.
- Reimplemented the Tome of Power.
- Removed DCanvas::DrawPageBlock().

July 13, 2004
- Fixed positioning of ML_DONTPEGBOTTOM for lower textures. Putting a sky
  ceiling on both sides of the line always makes unpegged positioning
  relative to the back sector's ceiling, not just when the back ceiling is
  above the front ceiling.
- Fixed: Saving a game would momentarily stop floatbobbers from bobbing.
  Since actors have a FloatBobPhase member, their height doesn't need to be
  adjusted when serializing them. (However, since the adjustment just gets
  undone, I'm not sure why it was a problem.)
- Fixed 16-rotation sprites so that the rotation boundaries are where you would
  expect them to be.
- Re-Fixed: CT_Drawer could try drawing the scoreboard when deathmatch is
  true, but you hadn't started a game yet.
- Added the inverse video flash when firing the Sigil.
- I don't know why the Oracle's spectre is able to teleport across its
  monster blocking lines, so I've given it the MF3_NOBLOCKMONST flag.
- Translucency of things in Strife has been corrected. Strife uses 25%/75%
  translucency. Walls are 75% and it's flipped to 25% for sprites. However,
  the spectres are really hard to see, so I've given them 33% translucency.
- Added genuine Strife falling damage. It is extremely unforgiving, so you'd
  better try not to fall too far while playing Strife.
- Added the yellow and red colors for the Strife health bar when your health
  drops to 20 and 10 respectively.

July 12, 2004
- Finished a play through of Strife, from beginning to end. (Woohoo! It works!)
  Now to finish the things that aren't quite right...
- Miscellanoues Strife bug fixing.

July 10, 2004
- The eight SPAC type has now been assigned: SPAC_PTOUCH, for when projectiles
  either impact or cross a line. Strife line type 182 needs this.

July 9, 2004
- Miscellaneous Strife fixing.
- Better support for not having a ready weapon at all.
- Changed the Sigil to use the normal weapon sprite instead of the flash
  sprite to show how many pieces you have.

July 8, 2004
- Fixed: Interpolations were not cleared when loading a brand-new level.
- Added support for snesapu.dll 2.0, which happened to be as simple as
  changing the version check, since none of the changes from 1.01 affect
  the functions I use.

July 7, 2004
- "Fixed:" Missiles that moved perfectly vertical would do no damage. Now
  missiles without any x/y velocity are given a very small x/y velocity so
  that they are not quite moving vertical.
- Added the GetSigilPieces() ACS command, which returns the number of Sigil
  pieces the activator has obtained.
- Added a third parameter to Teleport_NewMap that, when set to TRUE, will
  cause the player to keep their current facing when they move to the new map.
- Added the Hexen intermission text between hubs that I had forgotten about.
- Added map redirects, so if a player is carrying a particular item, they go
  to a different map instead. (Used for Strife maps 3 and 7.)

July 6, 2004
- Added support for the teaser version of Strife. It seems to be based on an
  older version of Strife than the one that was released to retail, so the
  mobjinfo list is different, the dialogues are slightly different, and some
  items have different names. The Teaser is fully playable.

June 30, 2004
- Added Strife's fire and disruptor deaths.
- Corrected the missile attack chances for the Strife monsters.

June 26, 2004
- Added Strife's breaking glass.

June 25, 2004
- Added a fix for Strife's LASERB01 texture. The Doom renderer ignored patch
  y offsets on masked mid-textures, so it got drawn as if the beam was at the
  top of the texture instead of the bottom. The "fix" is to adjust the rowoffset
  of the sides that it appears on.

June 24, 2004
- Made some corrections to the Strife blood and bullet puffs.
- Removed the global variable PuffType. It's now a parameter to those
  functions that use it. HitPuffType is also gone, because giving a puff a
  CrashState can make the same distinction.
- Added Strife's scanner.
- Added Strife's targeter, although it's kind of a useless item when the
  player can just go to the options menu and turn on a crosshair.

June 23, 2004
- Added th IF_INVBAR flag so that only selected items show up on the inventory
  bar.

June 21, 2004
- Removed the soundtarget sector property and made it an actor property. Now
  newly spawned actors won't wake up if you happened to make noise near their
  spawn point earlier.

June 20, 2004
- Fixed: A_FreezeDeathChunks could divide by zero for very small actors.
- Fixed: The EndPic "map" in mapinfo didn't work. It always tried to show the
  graphic "endseq" instead of what was specified in MAPINFO.

June 19, 2004
- Finished adding all of Strife's slideshows.

June 18, 2004
- Removed F_DrawPatchCol, since DrawTexture can do its own clipping.

June 15, 2004
- Added the Sigil, except for the inverse colors when shooting it. Does anyone
  else think its fourth mode really weak compared to the third and fifth?

June 10, 2004
- Moved the chicken speed mods out of P_MovePlayer and into
  AChickenPlayer::TweakSpeeds.
- Added a check for NULL cameras to the very end of CT_Drawer() where it checks
  to see if the scoreboard should be shown.
- Fixed: Trying to activate some manual types of specials would activate every
  tag 0 sector in the map if the back sector was already moving.
- Added support for paths with . in them to DArgs::GatherFiles when it checks
  if a file was specified with an extension or not.
- Added support for \ as a path seperator in DefaultExtension on Win32.
- Added the vid_displaybits cvar to control how many bits per pixel the
  fullscreen display gets created with. The game is still rendered in 8-bit,
  but this is for the benefit of cards that don't support that or work better
  with non-8-bit displays.
- The vid_attachedsurfaces cvar is now ignored unless you are running NT 4.

June 9, 2004
- Fixed: FDynamicColormap::BuildLights() did not check for a NULL Maps pointer.
- Fixed: Masked textures and sprites were not drawn correctly inside nested
  skyboxes because they would be drawn in the front skybox before drawing the
  second skybox, so the second skybox would cover up the ones in the first
  skybox.

June 2, 2004
- Removed all the other network commands related to managing weapon slots.
  Determination of which weapon to switch to is now done entirely on the
  local machine and sent using DEM_INVUSE, so the slots don't need to be
  replicated to the other players.

May 28, 2004
- Removed DEM_WEAPSEL as part of the inventory rewrite. DEM_INVUSE works
  instead. This also means the weapon console command is no more.

May 18, 2004
- Added division/modulus by zero checks to the ACS VM.
- Implemented the ACS_ExecuteWithResult special so the Strife specials
  implemented in ACS can function correctly.

May 17, 2004
- Removed the TeleportSide global variable and made it a line special parameter,
  which it should have been from the very beginning.
- Increased the limit for local script variables from 20 to 65535.

May 11, 2004
- Added Strife's delayed damage sectors.
- M_ActivateMenuInput now resets the state of the game buttons, so +use will
  work right away after talking to somebody.
- Added another validity check to FPatchTexture::MakeTexture to make sure the
  column doesn't go past the end of the patch when fed bad data.
- Added Strife's merchant conversation animations.

May 7, 2004
- Added Strife's animated doors.

May 6, 2004
- Added support for clipping midtextures on all lines, because I think Strife
  looks better that way. (Even though it looks like Strife does not do this.)
- Added Strife's railing and floater-blocking line flags.
- Add Strife's status bar popup screens.

May 5, 2004
- Moved artifacts to the new inventory system.

May 1, 2004
- Fixed: Build palette loading was unreliable after adding desaturation support
  to Sector_SetColor.

April 30, 2004
- Did some work on Strife's status bar.

April 25, 2004
- Added Strife's title sequence.

April 21, 2004
- Added Degnin Ore.

April 20, 2004
- Added lots of Strife line specials, ~30 done entirely through ACS.
- New ACS p-codes:
	PCD_CASEGOTOSORTED: Faster replacement for PCD_CASEGOTO.
	PCD_LSPEC5RESULT: Same as PCD_LSPEC5, but the result of the special's
		execution is left on the stack.
- New ACS internal functions:
	int GetLineRowOffset ();
		Returns the front side's rowoffset for the activating line.
		
	fixed GetActorFloorZ (int tid);
		Returns the highest floor point underneath the actor.
		
	int GetActorAngle (int tid);
		Returns the actor's angle. 65536 is 360 degrees.
		
	fixed GetSectorFloorZ (int tag, int x, int y);
		Returns the sector height (fixed point) at coordinates (x, y).
		(x, y) are not fixed-point, so you should specify (32, 16)
		instead of (32.0, 16.0).
		
	fixed GetSectorCeilingZ (int tag, int x, int y);
		Same as GetSectorFloorZ, except for ceilings.

	void SetResultValue (int value);
		Set's a script's "result value." Needs to be used before any
		functions that make the script wait. ACS_ExecuteResult and
		ACS_LockedExecuteResult will return this value.

April 12, 2004
- Changed the respawnmonsters flag into an int that holds the respawn
  interval, since Strife respawns at 16 second intervals, and Doom uses
  12 second intervals.

April 11, 2004
- Added Strife's Templar.

April 10, 2004
- Added Strife's Loremaster and Stalker.

April 9, 2004
- Added Strife's ceiling turret and fixed the alarm klaxon.
- Added the Strife quest items.

April 8, 2004
- Converted keys to the new inventory system and added Strife's.

April 7, 2004
- Added Strife door sounds.

April 6, 2004
- Added Macil.

April 2, 2004
- Converted the Heretic and Hexen artifacts to the new inventory system.

March 31, 2004
- Converted Doom's powerups to the new inventory system.

March 30, 2004
- Converted armor and health to the new inventory system.

March 26, 2004
- Fixed: The mauler's secondary fire had the wrong states.
- Started transitioning over to the Unreal-like inventory system, starting
  with the easiest first: Puzzle items (since they basically just sit in your
  inventory until used), then ammo and the backpack.
- Made the dialogues prettier with shadow boxes behind the text.

March 23, 2004
- More dialogue work: Now you can pick responses to the things NPCs tell you
  and drive the conversations along further. You can also get items from the
  responses. However, item checks aren't in yet, so no item-specific dialogue
  branches work.
- P_NoiseAlert now sets a new object flag, OF_IsSoundTarget, so that
  soundtarget clearing will work with non-players.
- Changed P_NoiseAlert( self, self->target ) in A_AlertMonsters() to
  P_NoiseAlert( self->target, self ), so monsters will target the player
  who shot the projectile instead of the projectile itself.

March 22, 2004
- Started work on the Strife conversation system. You can now +use things and
  they will say something to you, but you can't do any sort of conversing yet.
  Plus, Strife monsters now drop stuff when they die.
- Added autoloading of voices.wad when playing Strife.

March 17, 2004
- Changed COMPATF_NOTOSSDROPS behavior so that the items spawn at the monster's
  feet instead of on the floor.
- Changed the maximum thrust in P_DamageMobj() to 10*FRACUNIT. (Previously, it
  was only clamped to this if it was so large that it went negative.)
- Added AmmoPics for the Strife ammo types.
- Fixed: The phosphorus grenades used the HE grenades pickup message.
- Added some code from P_SpawnProjectile to P_Thing_Projectile so that it can
  support floor/ceiling huggers.

March 13, 2004
- Fixed: ARealGib's PROP_SpawnState was accidentally deleted.
- Fixed: P_Thing_Projectile always returned false when spawning non-missiles,
  and when spawning missiles, only returned the status of the last missile.
- Fixed: P_SpawnPlayerMissile used the original angle instead of the aimed
  angle to rotate the projectile in the X-Y plane.
- Fixed: AHolySpirit::SpecialBlastHandling() compared "< BLAST_FULLSTRENGTH"
  instead of "== BLAST_FULLSTRENGTH".
- Changed the parser for SS_CMD_VOLUME in s_sndseq.cpp to use a floating point
  division instead of an integer division. (Whoops!)
- Fixed: Pressing backspace on a file in the save game menu and then answering
  "no" when asked if you really want to delete the file would mess up the
  savegame menu.
- Removed the WeaponNames array from p_acs.cpp, because wpnlev1info provides
  the same information.

March 8, 2004
- Removed WIF_FIREDAMAGE, as it was unused.
- Changed AWeapon::OldStyleID() so that it is no longer virtual. Instead, it
  searches the wpnlev1info array to find the info that points to that class.
- Replaced A_CallSpecial and A_Script keywords in the thingdef parser with
  support for using specials by name. (e.g. Instead of using
  A_CallSpecial (80,...) or A_Script (...) you use ACS_ExecuteAlways (...)
  instead.
- Changed SC_ScriptError to be varargs, so passing parameters for the format
  string is more straight-forward.

March 3, 2004
- Eliminated the CustomActor class by moving some of its data into class
  metadata and the rest of it into function parameters. Now custom actors
  can properly derive from built-in classes.
- Replaced A_Explode in thingdef.cpp with A_ExplodeParms, so the explosion
  parameters can be a property of the state instead of a property of the
  actor.
- Renamed __BIG_ENDIAN__ to WORDS_BIGENDIAN to match autoconf's name for the
  #define.

March 2, 2004
- Added metadata support for TypeInfo, so classes can carry metadata around
  with them. This is intended to allow actors in DECORATE to properly derive
  from built-in actors. Whenever a scripting language for DECORATE gets
  implemented so that everything can be defined there instead of in C++, the
  metadata should no longer be needed.

February 10, 2004
- Upgraded to zlib 1.2.1.
- Merged in Graf Zahl's additions to thingdef.cpp.
- Fixed: Heretic wind specials would effect you while you were underwater.
  Also turned off the Heretic wind for noclipping things.
- Added a check for empty subsectors to P_LoadSubsectors.

February 6, 2004
- Fixed: DObject::IsKindOf used StaticClass instead of GetClass.
- Added Graf Zahl's thingdef.cpp implementation and modified it to work with
  a more C-like mode in sc_man.
- Fixed: P_CheckFakeFloorTriggers could crash if the action caused the player
  to teleport to a new sector without any sector actions.
- Fixed the Hexen armor depletion so that it doesn't overflow on very large
  damage amounts.
- Fixed: An extremely dead imp that crashes before executing A_ImpXDeath2 would
  get stuck floating in the air.
- Changed menuactive into an enum and merged WaitingForKey into it. Now closing
  the menu automatically disables the menu's key waiting mode. Also fixed,
  C_ToggleConsole so that the console can never be dropped down while the menu
  is open. Before, it was possible to do this by pressing Esc and ` during the
  same tic.

February 5, 2004
- Altered the BOOM pusher/puller/current effects to apply to anything with
  MF2_WINDTHRUST and removed the restriction that it doesn't apply to things
  with MF_NOGRAVITY. To make it work, I also had to remove MF_NOBLOCKMAP from
  all the wind-thrustable Heretic/Hexen projectiles.
- Fixed: Using the spray command with a non-existant decal crashed.

February 3, 2004
- Removed r_experimental.

January 29, 2004
- Added the -oldsprites command line argument to rename sprites in all
  wads instead of just sprites in the IWAD.
- Changed Heretic's knight sounds to be prefaced by hknight/ instead of
  knight/.
- Changed the Strife weapon names for the ACS inventory commands to match
  their actor names.
- Added Hexen's water drip (spawnnum 95). Changed the Hexen WATR->UWAT
  renaming to WATR->HWAT.
- Added a note to the map command that suggests you use changemap instead
  while playing a network game.
- Fixed: Chat mode could not be used outside of an actual level.
- Fixed: The automap still tried to draw teleporters with custom colors even
  when am_usecustomcolors was false.
- Fixed the Hexen armor saves so that it doesn't overflow on very large damage
  amounts.
- Put back the AKey::TryPickup restriction on picking up more than one key of
  the same type, but now it's restricted to multiplayer games only. Single
  player will still be able to pick up more than one.

January 26, 2004
- Fixed: FLOATRANDZ overflowed when the space between ceiling and floor was
  more than 297 units.

January 22, 2004
- Fixed: side_s::GetLightLevel() got the light of "sidedef" instead of "this".
- 2.0.61
- Optimized R_PrecacheLevel() so that it does not unload graphics that are
  definitely used on the level.
- Optimized the primary loop in P_GroupLines() so that it is much faster on
  large maps. It was previously O(m*n); now it is O(m+n), and Vrack 3 loads
  in well under a second.
- Changed the Heretic's imp's sounds to use the himp/ prefix instead of imp/.

January 21, 2004
- Fixed: The Heresiarch's spell balls above his head did not update their
  sector information as they rotated. Neither did his shield balls.
- Fixed silent teleporter orientation in EV_Teleport().
- Fixed calls to P_Teleport() in a_korax.cpp and a_teleportother.cpp that used
  weird parameters.
- Changed FDecalLib::GetDecalByName() so that it does not call GetDecal() on
  the decal it finds, so it can be used to get decal groups.
- Fixed: Saving a game on one version of a map, then adding a BEHAVIOR to it,
  then reloading would not fully invalidate the player when starting a new
  game after the resulting error message. (G_NewInit now initializes players
  to PST_DEAD).
- Added a screenshot_dir cvar to allow automatically-named screenshots to be
  saved somewhere other than the current directory.
- Fixed: M_ScreenShot left the display locked if it could not open the file to
  write to.
- Added decals for the marine hitscan weapons. (I think it's funny that the
  term "hitscan" has come to be used to describe Doom's instant-hit weapons
  even though it comes from Build. :-)

January 17, 2004
- Fixed: PIT_CheckOnmobjZ would not let things stand on corpses.
- Fixed a bug in A_MinotaurLook where I forgot to convert a special1 reference
  to a tracer reference.
- Fixed: Obituaries were shown when voodoo dolls died.
- Fixed: Light_Fade and Light_Glow divided by zero when using zero as the
  tics argument.
- Fixed: Killing a PlayerPawn that isn't attached to a player crashed.
- Fixed: Summoning before starting a game crashed.
- Fixed: Block everything lines did not block railguns.

January 13, 2004
- Fixed: +moveup and +movedown did not work with the fly cheat.
- Fixed: The Sentinel was missing the MF_DROPOFF flag. Also reduced its
  "bouncing" when it was in a float. I still wasn't satisfied with that, so
  I took its MF_FLOAT bit away.
- Fixed: The Strife flamethrower's refire state wasn't using frame B.
- Fixed: Acolytes only used frames A and B in their chase states because I
  forgot to change them when copying and pasting.
- Removed the nightmare warning when starting a bloodbath game in Strife.
- Fixed: Nightmare skill ignored the starting map defined with episodedef.
- Changed sv_fastweapon 2 handling so that it only applies to weapon
  psprites and not flash psprites.
- Changed Thing_Activate/Deactivate so they can be used to prevent frozen
  corpses from shattering automatically after a delay. (They can still be
  shattered by shooting them or pushing them off a ledge, however.)

January 12, 2004
- Changed AKey::TryPickup so that it doesn't fail if the player already has a
  key of the same type.
- Fixed: The TranslucentLine special could not used in a script if a line was
  used to activate the script.
- Changed the damage amount for automatic death from 10 thousand to 1 million,
  for people who like really strong monstres.

January 8, 2004
- Added some more player properties that let you add and remove player powers
  through ACS.
- Renamed pw_shield and pw_health2 to pw_unused1 and pw_unused2 because Heretic
  never used them. For the sake of savegame compatibility, they have not been
  removed.
- Changed the dragon skin bracers so that when they're used outside of Hexen,
  they add 50 points of armor. Also changed the armor bonus so that if you have
  more than 200 armor points, picking one up won't drop you down to 200.
- Added the WIF_AMMO_OPTIONAL flag so that the fighter's hammer and axe can be
  specified as using ammo so that they show up in Doom's fullscreen HUD.
- Changed masked texture drawing so that Y offsets behave like any other walls:
  by texel unless the texture requests otherwise.
- Changed APuzzleItem::ActivateArti() so that it always plays *puzzfail if the
  puzzle item could not be used.
- Fixed: Splashing on a fake floor with SECF_CLIPFAKEPLANES set would use the
  main sector's floor terrain instead of the control sector's floor terrain.
- Moved even more functionality out of A_WeaponReady so that weapon ready
  animations can use delays longer than one tic and still fire well.
- Fixed my September 25, 2003 "fix" of the massacre code so that it doesn't
  make already dead bodies shootable.
- Changed P_SightCheckLine() so that it also uses the absence of ML_TWOSIDED as
  an indicator to stop the search, as it did a long time ago.
- Fixed: A_M_Refire did not terminate the attack if the marine had no missile
  attack and the target had moved out of range.
- Fixed: DTA_VirtualHeight scaled the texture's y location by the display's
  width instead of its height.
- Added sprite renaming so that unique actors can use unique sprites. Only
  sprites in the main IWAD are renamed, so if you want to supply a new sprite
  in a PWAD, you need to use the sprite's new name instead of its old name.
  Sprites are renamed as follows:
	heretic.wad:	HEAD -> LICH
	
	hexen.wad:	ARM1 -> AR_1
			ARM2 -> AR_2
			ARM3 -> AR_3
			ARM4 -> AR_4
			BARL -> ZBAR
			CAND -> BCAN
			GIBS -> POL5	(this makes it the same as Doom's gib sprite)
			ROCK -> ROKK
			SUIT -> ZSUI
			TRE1 -> ZTRE
			TRE2 -> TRES
			WATR -> UWAT	(unused, but Strife also has a WATR)
			
	strife1.wad:	ARM1 -> ARM3
			ARM2 -> ARM4
			BAR1 -> BARC
			BARL -> BBAR
			BLST -> MAUL
			CNDL -> KNDL
			LOGG -> LOGW
			MISL -> SMIS
			PMAP -> SMAP
			POT1 -> MPOT
			SHRD -> SHAR
			SHT2 -> MPUF
			SPID -> STLK
			TLMP -> TECH
			TRE1 -> TRET
			TRCH -> TRHL
			VASE -> VAZE
- Fixed: The Doom Allmap powerup played the normal item pickup sound instead of
  the powerup pickup sound.
- Fixed: Fog boundaries were still drawn when using a fixed colormap.

January 6, 2004
- Fixed: R_InitTextures() did not ensure that the final TEXTURE1/TEXTURE2 lumps
  had not already been read, so it could end up loading them with the wrong
  PNAMES. The easiest example of this bug is to start the game with:
	-iwad doom2 -file doom doom2
- Fixed: You could take Heretic keys but you couldn't check them with ACS. Also
  added support for doing both with Hexen keys, since it was missing.
- Added some checks to A_SpawnFly to appease anybody who tries to break things
  by using dehacked patches where they don't belong.
- Fixed: If you used spynext/spyprev to look through another player's eyes and
  that player quit, the game would crash because it will still try to draw
  through that player's eyes.
- Added a DEM_SINFCHANGEDXOR message for flag cvars that alter server settings
  (i.e. all of them). The reason for this is because if you exec a script that
  alters multiple flags, only the last change would take effect, because they
  don't get processed until after the script finishes execution.
- Fixed: G_AddViewPitch() adjusted LocalViewPitch even when the dmflag
  DF_NO_FREELOOK was set.
- Fixed: PIT_StompThing was missing the MF2_TELESTOMP check for Heretic/Hexen.
- Fixed: Starting a game with the dmflag DF_NO_FOV set would set everybody's
  view to an FOV of 0 because the dmflags callback gets called before the
  arbitrator's DesiredFOV is initialized.

January 2, 2004
- Changed P_FinishLoadingLineDefs so that it rounds the wall length to the
  nearest integer when determining TexelLength instead of always round down.
- Fixed: Using an empty string with HUDMSG_TYPEON caused a crash.
- Fixed: A buried wraith could enter its pain state while rising from the
  ground and not properly finish raising, so its bottom portion would remain
  clipped for the rest of its existance.
- Fixed: Using a switch to start a script on another map would not make the
  switch switch.
- Fixed: Sliding along the backside of a blocking two-sided line was bad.
- Fixed: The second sky on a map defaulted to -NOFLAT- instead of the same
  texture as the first sky.
- Moved the key blocks from Heretic's fullscreen HUD so that they don't overlap
  the health vial.

December 13, 2003
- Added another case to ScanForFlatHack to fix darkhour.wad: F_START - flats -
  FF_END - more flats - F_END. I'm surprised it worked before, but it did, so
  I'm inclined to again make it work unmodified, even if the wad _is_ wrong.

December 12, 2003
- Added a hack check for Doom 1's BIGDOOR7 texture, which y offsets its patches
  at -4. (Doom clamped all negative patch y offsets to 0, which is why it shows
  up okay in Doom.)
- Added a fix to the blockmap tracers where all the blocks along the trace are
  crossed on their corners.
- Fixed a potential crash in DBaseStatusBar::DrawMessages() when a HUD message
  removes itself as part of its drawing process.
- Fixed: A few of the Strife weapons were erroneously defined with WIF_NOALERT.
- Fixed: Sky textures defaulted to 0 if a map had a MAPINFO that did not
  specify the sky. Now they default to -NOFLAT- so you don't have to worry
  about division by zero in R_DrawSkyStriped if the map tries to show a sky.
- Fixed: The floorLowerAndChange type for EV_DoFloor modified sec instead of
  a temporary, which could cause crashes at worst and odd behavior at best
  because sec is used again to determine whether a floor moved instantly.
- Changed a DivScale19 in R_RenderMaskedSegRange into a SafeDivScale19.
- Fixed: Trying to use the mdk command before starting a game caused a crash.
- Fixed: CreateFrameBuffer would not properly retry.
- Changed the maybedrawnow recursion inhibitter to use the current state
  of the screen object instead of a local static variable.

December 8, 2003
- Fixed: If a wad had TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 lumps, then any duplicates in
  TEXTURE2 took precedence over TEXTURE1. It is supposed to be the other way
  around, with TEXTURE1 taking precedence over TEXTURE2.
- Prefixed the names of the Strife grenade launcher actors with "Strife".
- Fixed: DDoor did not serialize m_LightTag.
- Fixed the P_TranslateTeleportThings rewrite so that it sets the Teleport
  special's TID to 1 instead of the tag.
- Added a check for MNTRZ0 to AT_GAME_SET(Minotaur).
- Fixed: The chaingun flash only showed frame one and not both frames one and
  zero.

December 6, 2003
- Rewrote P_TranslateTeleportThings() so that it only assigns TIDs to things
  in sectors with tag 0.
- Fixed: Teleporters by TID didn't work.
- Fixed: P_SpawnMissileXYZ spawned floor/ceiling huggers as if they could move
  with a vertical component to their velocity. They can't, so it could result
  in very slow moving projectiles when aiming at something nearby in the X/Y
  plane but far away on the Z axis, because most of the projectile's speed would
  try to go on the Z axis.
- Changed the Minotaur state fixup to be based on the presence of MNTRZ1
  instead of the game type.
  
December 5, 2003
- Fixed: When I went back to the blockmap-based sight code, I forgot to bring
  over the enhancements for block-everything lines I had made for the BSP-
  based sight code.
- Added a second argument to Teleport and a third argument to Teleport_NoFog
  specials. This is a sector tag to filter the teleport dests with. Only
  dests in a sector with a matching tag will be selected if the tag parameter
  is non-zero. If tid is zero and tag is non-zero, then the old (and slow)
  teleport dest based on sector tag is used so that Mordeth's trick can work.
- Added support for the BOOM local door light effect by adding an additional
  parameter to all the Door_* specials to serve as the lighttag parameter.
  The first argument still determines the door to open, so unlike BOOM, you
  can use the effect with remote doors if you like. In the case of the
  Generic_Door special, OR the type (the third argument) with 128, and the
  first argument will be used as the lighttag parameter instead of the tag
  parameter.
- Fixed two bugs with using the ACS setfont call to create fonts from images:
  GlobalKerning was left uninitialized, and they weren't added to the global
  font list, so they were recreated every time they were setfont'ed.

December 4, 2003
- Fixed: Voodoo dolls would also trigger the teleport zoom.
- Added 2048x2048 as the maximum size for a patch as a simple sanity check.
- Added a fix to the console's maybedrawnow() function to prevent recursive
  calls to it.

December 3, 2003
- Fixed: The transfer lights specials are supposed to copy the source sector's
  light level instead of propagating along changes from other transfer lights
  specials.
- Added an armor display to Heretic's fullscreen HUD to match Doom's.
- Added a check for a NULL spot to Earthquake::Tick() so that if somebody
  removes an earthquake's spot before the quake is over, it won't crash.
- Fixed: The Boom use-through flag was only being translated to SPAC_USETHROUGH
  for lines with generalized line types and not for lines with normal line types.
- Fixed: P_ActivateLine() did not consider SPAC_USETHROUGH lines when deciding
  if it should flip a switch texture.
- Fixed: In EV_DoCeiling(), ceilLowerToNearest made the ceiling go up instead
  of down.
- Fixed: PIT_AddThingIntercepts() did not add anything the trace started in,
  because none of the thing's sides faced the start of the trace.
- Added a check to A_FireCGun() to try to catch Dehacked patches that do
  naughty things to the chaingun's flash states.
- Fixed: The bNoDecals property was not copied to every texture in an
  animation range.
- Added the "range" keyword to ANIMDEFS so that it can be a true replacement
  for ANIMATED.
- Fixed: Crushers in Hexen made monsters disappear instead of turning them into
  piles of giblets.
- Changed P_SpawnPlayer() so that it doesn't telefrag *everything* inside the
  player. Only monsters and other players will be telefragged now.
- Fixed: Hurting a voodoo doll and then dying from something else didn't
  completely kill you.
- Fixed: mouse_sensitivity was no longer affecting mouselooking.

November 26, 2003
- Fixed: Ceiling type ceilRaiseToLowest (used exclusively by Ceiling_Generic)
  set the direction to -1 instead of 1.
- Fixed: P_TranslateLineDef() ignored the BOOM passthrough flag due to
  bad ordering.
- Fixed: A_WeaponReady did not center the sprites in case they had been
  repositioned earlier. (Only really an issue with Hexen.)
- Fixed kerning support in V_BreakLines.

November 24, 2003
- Moved the +mlook and +strafe button handling for joysticks into
  DI_JoyCheck().
- Changed bots.cfg loading so that it is relative to progdir instead of the
  current directory.
- Removed support for loading zdoom.ini from the user's profile directory
  under Windows.
- Added Strife's acolytes.
- Added Strife's rebel(s).
- Added Strife's beggar(s).
- Added Strife's zombie spawner.
- Fixed: No map names were shown for custom maps in the intermissions.
- Added simple default kerning for fonts so that DBIGFONT can use it to
  overlap the edges of two adjoining character cells. It does not support
  per-character kerning pairs and probably never will.
- Added error checks to invnext, invprev, and useflechette so that they won't
  crash if you try to use them before starting a game.
- Fixed: Picking up a DECORATE item would clear its special, so you wouldn't
  be able to pick it up again if it respawned.
- Added translucency to lots of Heretic and Hexen actors.
- In PIT_CheckThing(), any checks against a bridge will treat the moving
  actor as if it has MF2_PASSMOBJ set, even if it doesn't. This lets scrolling
  floors carry scenery items underneath a bridge without causing the chaos
  that removing MF2_PASSMOBJ globally would cause.
- Removed the dead player check from CheckIfExitIsGood() so that dead
  players can exit a level, as they could in Doom.
- Added god mode and invulnerability as things that can replenish your air
  supply, so you won't die almost immediately if you spend your time
  underwater with them on and then they go away before you surface.
- Added checks to D_PostEvent so that it won't turn the players head when
  the game is effectively paused.
- Added a new player flag, CF_WEAPONREADY, so that weapons which don't use
  A_WeaponReady (like the fighter's axe) can still bob.
- Fixed: The savegame version number for 2.0.54/2.0.55 didn't get bumped
  up. So the .55 update really only helps people who want to load pre-.52
  savegames. :-(

November 23, 2003
- Oops. Quick update from 2.0.54 to 2.0.55 to let old savegames load again.
  Hopefully nobody downloaded 2.0.54 in the hour it was available.
- The sector an actor resides in now gets stored in savegames, because
  different rules are applied for things spawned at level start than for
  things spawned afterward.
- Added calls to SetWindowLongPtr to take away the window's border in
  fullscreen mode and put it back in windowed mode.
- Fixed DBaseStatusBar::RepositionCoords() so that LilWhiteMouse's Chosen
  ammo icons appear on the fullscreen HUD again.

November 21, 2003
- Added Strife's "Becoming Acolyte".
- Added Strife's zombie.
- Added Strife's grenade launchers.

November 20, 2003
- Added Strife's merchants.
- Added a check for a NULL texture to the player setup drawer, even though
  that should never happen.
- Fixed: GiveInventory would not let you have more than one puzzle item of a
  certain kind because I thought Hexen restricted you that way.
- Fixed: Starting a non-deathmatch game, changing the deathmatch cvar to true,
  and then starting a new game would still show the ARMS graphic on the
  status bar because the status bar graphic was not reloaded.
- Changed the fast floor dropping behavior so that Hexen format maps use the
  Hexen behavior and Doom format maps use the Doom behavior.

November 19, 2003
- Added Strife's peasants.
- Added the Strife translation tables.
- Changed dehacked parsing so that the "Far attack frame" for players cannot
  be changed. Fixes insaned1.deh and insaned2.deh that come with insane.wad.
- Fixed: The intermission screen did not lookup level names.
- Added a check for a NULL target to A_FiredAttack.
- Fixed: Enter, respawn, and death scripts were run with the equivalent of
  ACS_Execute instead of ACS_ExecuteAlways, preventing them from executing
  for more than one player at once. This especially defeats the purpose of
  enter scripts, because those are always run at the same time for each
  player when the level starts, so only the first player would actually
  run any enter scripts.
- Fixed: The read-modify-write map array ops in p_acs.cpp took the array
  index from the world var store instead of the map var store.

November 18, 2003
- Added Strife's Sentinel.
- Adjusted P_SpawnMissileXYZ so that if a missile would normally shoot over
  the player's head, it will be aimed slightly lower.
- Added the first half of Strife's Bishop.
- Added Strife's Crusader (minus its special death action).

November 17, 2003
- Added a check for bad sidedefs to P_SaveLineSpecial.

November 15, 2003
- Added Strife's high-explosive and white phosphorous grenades (but not the
  grenade launchers).
- Fixed: AActor defined both reactiontime and ReactionTime.
- Moved weapon bobbing out of A_WeaponReady so that weapons can bob every
  tic even if A_WeaponReady isn't called every tic. (Such was the case with
  the mauler, and it looked really bad seeing it move jerkily only every six
  or seven tics.)
- Added Strife's mauler, minus the disintegration.
- Added a few of Strife's cheat codes.

November 14, 2003
- Added the Light_Stop line special to stop a currently running light effect.
- Changed the Door_Raise speed checks for monsters in P_TestActivateLine()
  so that they are consistant for cross, use, and push lines.
- Changed text lookups for map names and intermission text so that they
  happen each time they are needed and not just when the MAPINFO is parsed.
- Added a check for the null texture to R_RenderBoundWallSprite.
- Added a check for non-positive-sized patches, so if one tries to load,
  it gets replaced by the new -BADPATCH graphic I just added to zdoom.wad.
- Added support for flechette inventory graphics named ARTIPSB1, ARTIPSB2,
  and ARTIPSB3 that can be used in place of ARTIPSBG to differentiate
  between the different forms of the flechette when a script gives the
  player specific ones.
- Cluster infos now get created the first time they are referenced by a
  map. Without this, all Hexen maps were implicitly on the same hub (the
  "default" one), because Hexen didn't use clusterdef MAPINFO entries.
- Brought back the blockmap-based P_CheckSight and fixed the iterator in
  it and its equivalent in p_maputl.cpp so that it properly handles the
  case where a trace crosses the corner of a block.

November 12, 2003
- Added Strife's flame thrower.
- Added Strife's mini-missile launcher.
- Added Strife's assault gun.
- Added Strife's electric and poison crossbows. However, the poison bolt
  does not have any of its special properties implemented, so it currently
  acts like a super high damage projectile.
- Added all the Strife ammo pickups.
- Added Strife's scrolling sector type.
- Added the Strife weapon preferences to the WeaponPrefs array.
- Added placeholder weapon and ammo slots for the Strife weapons so that
  when/if I add more, I won't need to update the player_t serializer again
  to maintain compatibility with old save games.
- Added StepHeight to gameinfo_t to indicate the maximum height step a
  player can walk up. This is 24 in every game except Strife, which has it
  lower at 16.

November 10, 2003
- Fixed: ANIMDEFS animations animated every frame in the animation instead
  of just the base texture.
- Fixed: Texture animations defined in ANIMATED did not animate each frame
  in the sequence properly.

November 2, 2003
- Stopped using validcount to keep track of which Actors have already been
  checked by P_BlockThingsIterator. P_CheckSight and P_TraceBleed can both
  make validcount go up, so it is totally useless for P_RadiusAttack, which
  wound up doing damage to a thing for each block it touched that was in the
  blast area.
- Added DTA_ClipTop, DTA_ClipLeft, and DTA_ClipRight so that FlatFill can now
  use DrawTexture and draw the textures right-side-up again.
- Renamed negonearray to zeroarray to better reflect its contents.
- Changed PTR_TraceIterator() so that it will look at a line's flags and if
  it doesn't have ML_TWOSIDED set, then it will pretend it doesn't have a
  back side, even if it does.
- Fixed: BFG Marines could crash with a stack overflow during their refire
  pause because A_M_BFGSound() switches the marine back to its chase state,
  which tries to switch it back to its attack state. The solution: Make sure
  the marine's MF_JUSTATTACKED bit is set as long as its special1 is non-zero.
  Then A_Chase won't try to attack.
- Reduced the player's missile range from 20480 to 8192, because Doom's trace
  code is too inaccurate for long traces.

November 1, 2003
- Removed the missile attack from the chainsaw marine.
- Fixed: The cast finale ignored the player's gender setting because it didn't
  actually play the player's death sound from the player.
- Fixed: The Heretic episode 2 ending restored the palette in PLAYPAL instead
  of the one computed from PLAYPAL at the start of the game.
- Removed gamma stuff from FPalette, since Win32Video is responsible for
  handling gamma.
- Changed P_DoCrunch() so that it copies the render style from the crushed
  thing to the gib actor.
- Changed PIT_FloorDrop() so that only Hexen will let things fall with gravity
  when a floor quickly drops. The other games will yank them down.
- Changed missile attacks so that monsters behind block everything lines will
  try to shoot through the lines if they are set for impact activation and
  run a script. The assumption is that the script will remove the blocking
  flag so they can shoot past the line on their next attack.
- Changed back to the BSP-based sight checking for better accuracy.
- Changed the automap so that it uses 12 bits of fractional precision instead
  of 16 in order to display maps that are relatively close to the limits of
  the possible map extents.
- Changed the STCFN121 hack so that instead of discarding STCFN121 if it's
  in the IWAD, it will discard it if STCFN120 and STCFN 122 are not present.
  This should accomodate wads that provide their own fonts and copied it as
  an I instead of a y, and also wads that provide a real set of lower-case
  characters.
- Changed the sector soundorg calculation so that it can't overflow.

October 31, 2003
- Added Strife's Reaver. Aside from its unknown flag, it should be fully
  functional.
- Added Strife's dagger-wielding fist. It has a chance of doing 0 damage,
  which seems odd.
- Extended P_SpawnPuff() so that you can give a puff a crash state, and then
  it will use that state if something was hit.
- Added a simple status bar for strife.

October 30, 2003
- Moved SKYFLATNAME into the gameinfo structure.
- Added a bunch more Strife things.
- Restricted the use of SPAC_OTHERCROSS to just the BOOM generalized line type
  containers, since those are the only specials it's needed for.
- Fixed: Each level's intermission name was always drawn as text, even if
  it had a graphic that was supposed to be displayed instead.
- Rewrote the flat hack used to make the flats in Gothic DM 2 load and
  verified that it once again works.

October 29, 2003
- Added a few Strife things.
- Fixed another Doom bug/oversimplification: PIT_AddThingIntercepts() checked
  the trace against a line running through the middle of the thing. Now it
  checks against the thing's actual bounding box, so chainsawing big things
  like the Spider Mastermind is much easier now. This also means
  P_LineAttack() doesn't need to position puffs/bullet splats closer along the
  trace since the hit location won't be inside the thing anymore.
- Changed blockmap thing linking so that things link to every block they touch
  and not just the block at their center, fixing an old Doom bug.
- Changed the summon command so that it spawns things in front of you based on
  their radius rather than a fixed 64 units away.
- Fixed: The joystick read rate was determined by the framerate instead of
  being a constant 35 Hz.

October 28, 2003
- Changed: Decals are not allowed on warping textures by default. You can allow
  them by appending "allowdecals" to the warp statement in ANIMDEFS. (e.g.
  "warp texture foofoo allowdecals")
- Fixed: Bots whose teams were defined by name instead of numbers would always
  be on the red team (team 0).
- Fixed: Puzzle items need to stick around in multiplayer games.
- Fixed: Saving in multiplayer games would try to save to the same full path
  on all machines, even if the different machines had ZDoom installed in
  different directories. The only one who was guaranteed to be able to save
  because of this was the person who used the save command.
- Fixed: Poison damage in multiplayer games did not respect the teamdamage
  setting.
- Added a minimum size limit of 1024 bytes for MOD/stream songs to work around
  a bug in the current version of FMOD 3.70.
- Fixed: Sprites with weird rotation flipping (e.g. the Hell Knight) did not
  display properly.
- Fixed: Even things that are not monsters could activate monster-allowed
  lines in BOOM (and presumably DOOM).
- Fixed: Compat_useblocking also needs to block non-use lines with specials,
  not just use lines.
- Fixed: Assigning a special to a line that would normally block the use of
  lines behind it would enable those lines to be used.
- Fixed: If a texture had the bNoRemap0 flag set and it was part of an
  animation sequence, the flag would not be propagated to the other
  textures in the sequence.
- Added a check for a NULL SaveComment in the for loop that draws the comment
  on the save/load menus.
- Fixed: Hexen does not always pass the three ACS script arguments as the
  first three variables as a script. Instead, it looks at the number of
  used arguments and only copies the arguments that are used, initializing
  the rest to 0.
- Fixed the COLORMAP fixer so that it works correctly for palettes where
  an exact match for color 0 does not exist.
- Added a check for empty VERTEXES lumps to the map loader.

October 27, 2003
- Fixed: You could not override the levelnums of the IWAD maps with levelnums
  pointing to differently named maps because levelnums were search first to
  last, and there was no check done to make sure that previous matching
  levelnums were removed.
- Moved the R_Init() call before DecalLibray.ReadAllDecals() so that decals
  can use any textures (including the plasma ball sprite).
- Fixed Heretic intermission problems: The maps were not shown because the
  cluster numbers changed when I moved its MAPINFO into zdoom.wad, and the
  "Now entering:" and "Finished" texts were incorrectly centered.

October 25, 2003
- Increased MAX_ACS_TRANSLATIONS to 255.
- Added APROP_Invulnerable.
- Changed savegames so that they store textures by name and usetype instead of
  by index. Also removed support for loading save games created with ZDoom
  versions earlier than 2.0.43 just for the purpose of removing obsolete code.
- Fixed: Unscaled skies taller than 128 were positioned incorrectly.
- Fixed: Redefining a clusterinfo with MAPINFO would not zero out the old
  clusterinfo.
- Fixed: When a palette had no duplicate entries, it used the blue and green
  parts of color 255 to pick a replacement for color 0.

October 24, 2003
- Added MF4_ACTLIKEBRIDGE flag.
- Fixed: Inventory items would fall through invisible bridges.
- Changed the P_TeleportMove() call in P_SpawnPlayer() so that it uses ONFLOORZ
  instead of mobj->z, which fixes some stuckiness that can occur with start
  spots that are too near a wall.

October 23, 2003
- Fixed: Overlapping bridge things would stand on each other.
- Changed TX_START/TX_END loading to load textures from first to last instead
  of last to first, so ANIMDEFS animations that use them will behave as
  expected.
- Fixed: m_filter did not average the mouse input. It just cut it in half.
- Fixed: Mouse pitch only changed in increments of 16.
- Fixed: ZDoom set the display mode twice at startup: Once at the very
  beginning and again right after its initialization finished.
- Fixed: AImpactDecal::StaticCreate() checked the texture on a wall using
  translation, so it would stick decals on animated textures unless the
  first frame was showing.
- FMOD_File_SetCallbacks() does not seem to work with FMOD 3.70. Fortunately,
  FMOD 3.70 also makes it obsolete for my purposes, so I can work around it.
  (Okay, so it was fixed again in a later FMOD 3.70. But I already removed
  the use of FMOD file callbacks, so I won't undo my changes now.)

October 22, 2003
- Rewrote my TAG_MORE handling to use va_list and make GCC happy.
- Fixed the default Heretic/Hexen automap wall colors so that they look
  good on the parchment background.
- Fixed: FindShortestTextureAround() and FindShortestUpperAround() returned
  their results as ints (without a fractional part) instead of fixed_ts.
- Changed the mapthing position fixing so that it only applies to those things
  that request it (specifically, Heretic's WallTorch).
- Moved all the default MAPINFO out of the executable and into zdoom.wad.
  As a side effect, Dehacked patches can no longer change the music played
  on a map. (Do any patches actually do this?)
- Converted all the decals in zdoom.wad into PNGs. I was considering doing
  the same for the crosshairs, but XHAIRB2 was the only one that got smaller
  from the conversion from IMGZ to PNG.

October 20, 2003
- Added the CreateTexture() method to the texture manager. It checks the
  contents of a lump to determine what type of image it contains, creates a
  texture of the appropriate type, and adds it to the database. Everything
  that was previously hard-coded to use patches now uses this instead. The
  primary reason for this: PNG texture support. Just make sure your PNGs are
  paletted. They do not need to have the exact same palette as the one
  inside PLAYPAL, since they will be remapped to fit the game palette. ZDoom
  also supports two proprietary PNG chunks:
	grAb (8 bytes):
	    SIGNED DWORD x
	    SIGNED DWORD y
	  grAb stores the offset information and works just like the
	  equivalent information in a patch. The name is taken from the
	  ILBM GRAB chunk, which does the same thing for ILBMs.
	alPh (0 bytes)
	  alPh is valid for grayscale images only (colortype 0). Its presence
	  signifies that the image data is really an alpha channel and contains
	  no color information. This is used by all of the decals in zdoom.wad.
- Added the m_filter cvar (false by default) to smooth out mouse movement for
  those unfortunate enough to be stuck with a mouse sampling rate of just 40 Hz.

October 18, 2003
- Added super-preliminary support for playing Strife as an IWAD.
- Added fading "Read This!" screens.
- Morphed players are now allowed to predict their positions.
- Revisited the local player turning from October 10. My original
  implementation had the players transmit the direction they wanted to face.
  Unfortunately, this messes up the gauntlets and chainsaw, so I have reworked
  it so that the players again send deltas. Any amount that accumulates between
  packet sends is added to the player's local view angles. When they get sent,
  they are zeroed.

October 17, 2003
- Fixed: GetLightLevel() used some globals instead of this to get the sidedef.

October 16, 2003
- Fixed: Using a cycling alias to rapidly change the player's color would
  animate the player's status bar face at each color change.

October 15, 2003
- Updated to FMOD 3.70.
- Did more cleanup for GCC. Its "variable might be used uninitialized"
  warnings are very annoying. Oh well.
- Did some cleanup so that Visual C++ 6 will compile without warnings. Alas,
  it has some really weird errors where it complains about not being able
  to #include .h files that are excluded inside an #ifdef block. They do not
  effect the compilation any and seem to be generated before cl is even run;
  it just looks untidy. Trivia, since I now have the opportunity to check:
  When built with exactly the same settings, compared to the VC6 version, the
  VC7 version is ~100k smaller, marginally faster, and takes slightly less
  time to build from scratch.
- Added the MAPTEXF_WORLDPANNING flag to indicate that a maptexture wants to
  be panned by world units instead of texels, so you can create high-res
  drop-in replacements for existing textures.
- Fixed: The grid was not drawn properly on a rotated automap because the
  x or y coordinates of the gridlines were not reset after being rotated. It
  still looks bad if you turn off follow mode, but I'd rather not worry about
  that.
- Fixed: Movement prediction did not preserve the ordering of blockmap links,
  so the local player would always be the first entry in his blockmap cell.
  The effects of this were first noticed as Pain Elementals reliably causing
  the game go out of sync eventually. I imagine it probably caused desyncs in
  other cases, too.

October 14, 2003
- Fixed: You could push actors with the MF2_PUSHABLE flag while doing movement
  prediction, which would almost invariably make network games go out of sync.
- Uncommented the check that excluded the loading of STCFN121 only if it was
  in the main IWAD. Note to anybody modding ZDoom who loads a resource wad
  before the IWAD: This check in the FFont constructor assumes the IWAD is
  at position 1. You will need to change this for your mod.
- Fixed: Pig players could still change back to their original weapons.
- Replaced the use A_BeakReady with A_WeaponReady. A_BeakReady was basically
  just a stripped-down version of A_WeaponReady, so A_WeaponReady works just
  as well.
- Added the ActivateMorphWeapon method to APlayerPawn as a replacement for
  P_ActivateMorphWeapon().

October 13, 2003
- Improved the error-checking in FPatchTexture::MakeTexture() so that it will
  detect overlapping spans.
- Fixed: Scaled, lower unpegged masked textures were positioned incorrectly
  vertically.
- Fixed vertical positioning of scaled sky textures.
- Made MF_COUNTITEM actors dynamically counted like MF_COUNTKILL actors.
- Fixed: Morphed players returned to their player skin unless playing Hexen.
- Fixed: The chicken and pig players did not have MF3_NOBLOCKMONST set.
- Moved P_MorphPlayerThink() into an overridable method of PlayerPawn.
- Fixed: Colored sectors changed the color of the crosshair.

October 11, 2003
- Dropped MISSILERANGE back to its original value (2048 units) and added a new
  PLAYERMISSILERANGE for player weapons, which is still at 20480 units.

October 10, 2003
- Fixed: Using the last inventory item in a Doom game would not redraw the
  Doom guy's face on the status bar until the next time it animated.
- Fixed: The view was interpolated when switching in and out of chasecam mode.
- Changed player turning to be local. Also changed the mouse reading so that
  it happens every frame instead of every tic. Together, these two changes
  keep the mouse feeling responsive even when the framerate drops below 35 FPS.
  It also helps a lot when playing with vsync enabled.
- Modified the interpolation system so that it knows what it is interpolation
  (beyond being just a generic fixed_t *). Now it can be stored in save games.
- Fixed: Ceiling_CrushAndRaise and similar specials that passed a 0 height
  to EV_DoCeiling/EV_DoFloor did not interpolate.
- Fixed: Thing_Projectile2 did not pop its parameters off the stack.
- Modified tab completion slightly. Pressing tab once now displays a list
  of possible completions. Pressing tab multiple times will continue to
  function as it did before.
- Added the fading notify text I had written for my Duke port.

October 8, 2003
- Changed titlepic and conback drawing to always be unmasked, because
  2nd_enc.wad's TITLEPIC has holes in it.
- Stripped out a bunch of obsolete code from v_draw.cpp.
- Moved the state of the automap cheat into the am_cheat cvar.
- Changed P_TestActivateLine() so that monsters cannot activate Door_Raise
  lines with speeds of 64 or above, in order to mimic Doom.
- Fixed: Vertical view doubling crashed.
- Made the secret wall color on the automap configurable through the 
  am_secretwallcolor cvar.
- Added a ga_togglemap gameaction, because the new parchment can cause
  commands to dispatch while the background is drawing. If one of those
  is togglemap and it gets handled right away, the mapback texture gets
  unloaded, and AM_clearFB will crash.
- Added the parchment background used by the Heretic and Hexen automaps.
- Added some support for console fonts that don't use 8x8 character cells.
- Fixed: A_WraithMissile was missing a NULL target check.
- Fixed: The player did not make any noise during the cast finale.
- Added the player's attack sound to the finale.
- Added a check to the cast finale for monsters that have been dehacked to
  have no attack states so that they won't crash the finale.

October 7, 2003
- Added DoomBounce, HereticBounce, and HexenBounce as valid properties for
  DECORATE projectiles.
- Fixed: Monster telefrags still reported that the monster had killed the
  player normally. (Note: The only time a monster will normally be able to
  telefrag a player is on Doom2 MAP30, although this can be changed with
  MAPINFO.)
- Made AM_changeWindowLoc scale the window movement so the automap will scroll
  at the same rate no matter what resolution you play at.
- Fixed: Reopening a door while it was closing would not play the opening
  sound.
- Fixed: You could still (de)activate dead monsters. Activating a dead monster
  would make it disappear, because dead monsters usually have their next frame
  set to NULL.
- Fixed an off-by-one error for the vertical positioning of the elements on
  the Hexen status bar.

October 3, 2003
- Fixed: Missing TAG_DONE is WI_slamBackground().
- Fixed: ZDoom no longer tries to read non-V3.0 Dehacked patch files. Earlier
  ones are apparently all binary, which has never been supported and could
  make it crash.

October 1, 2003
- Added support for specifying animated texture sequences in ANIMDEFS by name
  instead of by number. i.e. Instead of:
	texture x_water1
	pic 1 rand 5 12
	pic 2 rand 5 12
	pic 3 rand 5 12
	pic 4 rand 5 12
	
  You can write:
	texture x_water1
	pic x_water1 rand 5 12
	pic x_water2 rand 5 12
	pic x_water3 rand 5 12
	pic x_water4 rand 5 12
- Added a check for the front sky layers of parallax skies so that the front
  texture does not have color 0 remapped, because it really does use color 0
  as transparent. (Note that since color 0 is now the transparent color for
  everything, you can use normal transparent regions for front sky textures.)

September 27, 2003
- Changed the transparent color index from 255 back to 0. 0 is more convenient
  because:
   1) Images that are used as alpha masks (primarily decals) already
      use color 0 as transparent, so they no longer need special processing.
   2) PNG images need 255 fewer bytes to mark color 0 as transparent than they
      need to mark color 255 as transparent. But this won't really be important
      until I add support for PNG images (which will probably happen, but who
      knows when).
  The only reason I switched to 255 was because that was what BUILD used, so by
  using the same transparent index, I could memory map its tiles read-only and
  use them directly.

September 26, 2003
- Fixed: If a switch defined in a SWITCHES lump used the same "on" and "off"
  graphics, the game would crash. Now it gets skipped, because it's not really
  a switch if it doesn't change its image.

September 25, 2003
- Fixed: Using the MDK cheat always flung the dead things at you. Related, the
  maximum thrust to have something fall forward on death is now 10 units/tic.
- Fixed: ClearInventory always crashed because using GiveInventory to give a
  weapon afterward would not bring the weapon up, so the player's ready weapon
  would be left as something that doesn't exist.
- Fixed: The overlayed automap showed statistics when not viewing through a
  player's eyes.
- Increased MISSILERANGE to 20480 (was 2048).
- Changed the massacre code so that it sets the shootable bit for any monsters
  that have it cleared (such as Serpents, usually), so they die too.
- Fixed: Masked midtextures beneath a fake floor (or above a fake ceiling)
  only inheritted their light level and not their light color from the control
  sector.
- Added code so that when a map thing is spawned directly on a line, it will
  be moved 1/4 unit in toward the middle of the subsector so that it will be
  clipped reliably by the renderer. See the torch right in front of the player
  at the start of Heretic E1M1 for an example of this bad practice.
- Changed: MF2_FLOATBOB actors no longer splash on liquids.
- Fixed: P_AimLineAttack() clamped the player's vrange to 1 degree maximum
  instead of 1 degree minimum, so it would not aim past any two-sided lines
  if you were using 0 autoaim because the toppitch and bottompitch would be
  the same before even entering PTR_AimTraverse. This was the cause of
  chainsaw not always pulling you in and melee weapons sometimes missing
  monsters that were clearly in range.
- Fixed: P_SpawnPuff() used linetarget instead of its hitthing parameter
  to determine if it should play the puff's SeeSound or AttackSound.
- Improved(?) the Bloodscourge so that its initial target search only looks
  in front of the player.
- Fixed: MStaffSpawn used linetarget, but P_AimLineAttack was never called
  to set it.
- Fixed: P_CheckMissileSpawn would destroy ripping missiles if they spawned
  inside something.
- Fixed: Dark servants could not be morphed in Hexen.
- Fixed: MageWandSmoke was not translucent.
- Combined all the WeaponPrefs list for each game into a single list.
- Added text skipping for the Hexen chess ending.
- Fixed: The chessboard finale drawer looked at userinfo.PlayerClass instead
  of CurrentPlayerClass to decide which chess piece to draw, so random players
  would always appear as the fighter.
- Fixed: When V_BreakLines() inserted newlines for word wraps, the default
  text color was restored for the new lines. Now it adds color escape
  sequences after any soft line breaks, but it leaves hard line breaks alone.
- Added support for marking scripts that are "safe for multiplayer". To do
  this, add net after the script header but before the script body. e.g.:
	script 1 (void) net { ... }
	script 1 open net { ... }
	script 1 enter net { ... }
	etc.
- Added the sethudsize ACS command. It takes three parameters:
  sethudsize (width, height, statusbar). The width and height is the size
  of the screen that hudmessage thinks it's drawing on. If this is different
  from the real screen size, the hudmessage will be scaled to make it fit.
  If statusbar is 1, then the height parameter covers the status bar and you
  can draw on top of the status bar. If it is 0, then the hud message will
  be stretched differently depending on whether the status bar is visible or
  not, because the height available to draw in is shorter when the status bar
  is visible. (However, a value of 0 will still let you draw on the status
  bar if the hud message extends below the height you specified.)
  
  After using sethudsize, hudmessage coordinates also behave differently.
  You now need to specify actual pixel coordinates and not numbers in the
  [0.0, 1.0] range. However, they are still fixed point, so you need to keep
  the decimal point. e.g. If you used SetHudSize (320, 200, 1); and want to
  draw a hudmessage at the center of the screen, you should pass it the
  coordinates (160.0, 100.0) and not (0.5, 0.5).
  
  The fractional part of the coordinates effect what part of the hud message
  you are positioning:
	For x:	.0 = positions center of box
		.1 = positions left edge of box
		.2 = positions right edge of box
		.4 = centers text inside box
		     .4 can also be added to either .1 or .2 to get .5 or .6
		
	For y:	.0 = positions center of box
		.1 = positions top edge of box
		.2 = positions bottom edge of box

  e.g. If you used SetHudSize (320, 200, 1);, then the coordinates (160.1, 100.1)
  will position the upper-left corner of the hud message. The coordinates
  (160.2, 100.2) will position its lower-right corner instead.
  
  To make hudmessage behave as normal, use SetHudSize (0, 0, 0);.
  
  In summary, use sethudsize for hud messages that are really graphics, and don't
  use it for text (unless you want your text to appear the same size at all
  resolutions, such as a title with a special font or something).
  
- Added the getcvar ACS command. It returns the value of a cvar as an int,
  so scripts can alter their behavior based on cvars.
- Added the strlen ACS command. It behaves just like its C counterpart.
- Added support for loading compressed GL nodes when regular nodes are
  unavailable.
- Fixed: You could pick up items above your head because P_CheckPosition()
  added an extra 24 units of height to detect when you might step up inside
  another actor. It still does, but now PIT_CheckThing() takes this into
  consideration before touching it.

September 24, 2003
- Fixed a crash bug in A_SorcOffense2: It did not check for a NULL target.
- Added support for compressed nodes. Not only do they take up less space
  on disk than regular nodes, but the also remove the limits on number of
  segs, subsectors, and nodes that normal nodes have. They also store the
  extra vertices as 16.16 fixed point numbers like GL nodes, so split segs
  can have fractional end points.

September 23, 2003
- Finished switching from memory-mapped I/O to normal file I/O. Partly, this
  was done for portability, because some systems don't support MMIO, but
  mostly it was done because the in-memory format of textures no longer
  matches their on-disk format, so I can't use the wads themselves as a
  texture cache anymore. Since I can't do that anymore, there's not much
  reason to dedicate any address space to them.

September 13, 2003
- Added r_skyboxes cvar so that skyboxes can be turned off.
- Fixed: Using noinventorybar in MAPINFO still showed the selected artifact
  in the Doom status bar.
- Note to self: I am no longer using Whole Program Optimization because:
  1. It makes the executable around 200k bigger right now.
  2. Its performance improvements are debatable. In fact, ZDBSP is about
     half a second slower on a big map when using it.
  3. It makes the linking stage of a release build take a lot longer
     (which would be worth it if it actually helped, but I haven't seen it).
- Changed the PNG reader so that it caches all basic chunk information in
  memory the first time the file is scanned so that chunk searches can be
  much quicker. This means that when you have a lot of .zds files, the save
  and load menus should hopefully appear faster the first time you use them.
  In the process of implementing this, I discovered a glaring bug:
  G_DoLoadGame() never closed the file after loading all the data from it.
- Added a check to disallow predefined 2D images as textures on walls, floors,
  and ceilings at map load time. I purposefully left this check out of ACS
  because they *can* be useful, so it's nice to have some way to use them.
- Added TX_START/TX_END markers for new graphics. They can override existing
  wall textures and flats.

September 9, 2003
- Fixed: STFBANY was not added to the texture manager, so multiplayer Doom
  games crashed when the status bar tried to draw it.
- Fixed: Options menu titles were drawn using SmallFont instead of BigFont.

September 6, 2003
- Fixed: Trying to delay for 0 tics in a script would delay for 4294967296
  tics instead.

September 2, 2003
- Fixed relative lighting was never applied to masked midtextures because I
  had the check contingent upon the absence of a sector colormap. But every
  sector always has a colormap; I should have been checking for a black
  fade instead.

August 28, 2003
- Fixed: Spawning an item with ACS that was Dehacked would not transfer the
  special or TID from the original item to the dehacked item.
- Fixed: AnimType was left uninitialized when parsing ANIMDEFS.

August 14, 2003
- Fog boundaries alone are no longer sufficient to clip a sprite.

August 13, 2003
- Fixed mirror flipping in R_ProjectSprite(). I was treating tx as if it were
  in screen coordinates, but it's not. This was generally unnoticable because
  tx has 16 fractional bits, so subtracting it from viewwidth was vear near
  subtracting it from 0.
- Changed sprite clipping by slopes to be more like sprite clipping by unsloped
  floors and ceilings.
- Removed the check for MF_SOLID in P_TestMobjZ(). Nonsolid things should
  still be blocked by invisible bridges. (So no more corpses will fall through
  invisible bridges.)
- Added the ability for monsters to walk on invisible bridges. Note that the
  bridge's top must be below or at the monster's height. Bridges that require
  even a slight step up will still be impassible to monsters. (For now. Maybe
  some time in the future I will change that. Maybe.)
- Fixed: R_ProjectParticle() could project 0-width particles. This could cause
  a single column of a fog boundary behind the particle to be drawn more than
  once.
- Fixed a bug in R_RenderMaskedSegRange() that caused one-pixel wide ranges
  to not be drawn when using r_columnmethod 1.
- Added support for extended ID666 amplification tags in SPC files. Doing so,
  I discovered one change from snesapu 0.95 to 0.98: SetDSPAmp's scale has
  12 more fractional bits in 0.98 than it did in the earlier versions.
- Updated SPC support for snesapu.dll version 1.01, meaning that I allowed for
  a higher minimum version returned by SNESAPUInfo. Nothing else needed to
  change, so I'm not sure why the minimum version got bumped. I did need to
  change the mixer parameter of SetAPUOpt from 0 to -1, but 0 was also defined
  as no mixer in snesapu 0.95, so I'm not sure why it worked with the older
  DLL.
- Added a check for textures that try to reference a patch not in the PNAMES
  lump.

August 11, 2003
- Removed the +1 from the damage calculations in PIT_RadiusAttack(). I'm not
  sure what that was doing there.
- Changed the VirtualProtect() call that makes the self-modifying code
  writable from PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE after
  Timmie found out Win9x doesn't know what PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY is.

August 5, 2003
- Changed the ignoreInvisibility parameter of P_CheckSight() to a flags
  parameter so that I can pass another flag (2) to indicate that the sight
  check should see past "block everything" lines (the former default). By
  default, sight checks no longer see past "block everything" lines, so
  monsters will not be able to melee attack you through them, and explosions
  will not be able to do splash damage through them.
- Fixed: Hitscan weapons always triggered the front side of an impact line,
  even when they struck the back side.
- Added a fifth argument to Sector_SetColor to control how much the
  palette should be desaturated. 0=leave it alone, and 255=shades of
  gray. The palette is desaturated before it gets colored. The test color
  console command can also take this parameter now.
- Added a new polyobject start spot (#9303) that causes the polyobject to
  deal damage whenever it touches a player.
- Changed sprite loading so that you can have sprites with gaps in their
  defined frame ranges again. (e.g. create frames A-D and H-N but not E-G)
- Fixed: Minisegs were messing up the polyobject seg detection code when
  GL nodes were used.
- Fixed: Fullbright sprites would be drawn fullbright in levels with their
  own fadtable (IOW, every foggy Hexen map) because g_level.cpp never made
  a note for the renderer to look at discover that the level used a custom
  fadetable.
- Added separate floor and ceiling skyboxes. Set the sky picker's second
  argument according to what you want to set: 0=floor and ceiling,
  1=ceiling only, or 2=floor only.
- Fixed: Undefined sky textures are once again replaced by the default
  texture instead of the empty texture.
- Fixed: Shooting a railgun while standing on a ledge could make you fall
  through the ledge because the railgun invisible moves you to the hit
  point in case it needs to make a water splash, then moves you back to
  your start spot. However, when it moved you back, it did not restore
  some important variables like floorz.
- Changed the weaponless marines so that their spawn state does not cycle
  between frames A and B. This holds even if you give them a weapon later
  in a script, but it does not hold for marines that spawn with a weapon,
  even if you take the weapon from them later.
- Fixed: The Heresiarch's orbiting balls did not have their floorz updated
  when the Heresiarch's changed, so if the Heresiarch's head went below its
  original floor height, its balls would rapidly jump between its head height
  and the old floor height. Since it seemed relevant, I also did the same
  for ceilingz. I also did it for the SorcFX2 effect (invulnerability
  indicator).
- Added support for nested skyboxes. Now you can have one skybox look into
  another skybox. The changes required were surprisingly minor.

August 2, 2003
- Fixed: Returning from one function to another function failed to take into
  account the presence of the calling function's return info when it restored
  its local variable pointer.

July 31, 2003
- Fixed a crash when using path followers with incomplete paths.

July 30, 2003
- Added CheckModified() method to FTexture for the benefit of ZDoomGL.
- Added nonexistant texture check to the warping texture setup.

July 28, 2003
- Removed the ScaleCopy canvas from DBaseStatusBar, because everything is now
  drawn to the screen directly even when the status bar is scaled.
- Changed the pitch calculations in the DSimpleCanvas constructor to provide
  better wall drawing performance at all resolutions.
- Corrected ::ST_Y calculation so that a scaled status bar does not have its
  topmost line overwritten by the view window at certain resolutions.

July 25, 2003
- Added DTA_WindowLeft and DTA_WindowRight tags for DCanvas::DrawTexture
  to restrict the portion of the source texture that gets drawn to the
  screen. Changed doom_sbar.cpp to use these, keeping in mind that they don't
  clip the vertical range of the texture.
- Improved the behavior of R_DrawMaskedColumn(Horiz) so that when using
  non-integral scaling and drawing adjacent columns that end at different y
  locations, the shorter column lines up better with the longer one.
- Fixed: R_SetSpanSize_ASM had the x and y sizes swapped when called in a
  release build but not a debug build. To fix, I just removed its __regargs
  entry point.

July 20, 2003
- Disabled interpolation for sliding polyobjects that complete their movement
  in fewer than three tics. (The moving crate effect in Massmouth 2 this fixes
  needs two tics to reloop the crate.)
- Turned off interpolation of instant movement floors and ceilings so as not
  to ruin the fake moving sector effect used in a few wads.
- Added a call to R_SetupBuffer() at the end of R_RenderViewToCanvas so that
  the ylookup table will be correct if the game was saved while watching the
  automap.
- Fixed: Every two-sided line was storing midtexture information even if it
  didn't have a midtexture.
- Changed ylookup into an array of ints instead of BYTE*s so that I can still
  use the common column drawers for everything even when the viewwindow does
  not start at (0,0). If you were using "dc_ylookup[y]" before, now you need to
  use "dc_ylookup[y] + dc_destorg" to get the same value.
- Fixed: Skybox ceilings could sometimes be left undrawn if they were in the
  same sector as a skybox floor because I was missing a check for plane height
  in R_FindPlane. This only applies to skyboxes; the check was present for
  normal skies.

July 19, 2003
- Fixed spacing of the characters on the finale text.
- Fixed clipping of scaled sprites in deep water.

July 18, 2003
- Fixed: remove was uninitialized in ParseEpisodeInfo().

July 17, 2003
- Moved the P_LoadBlockmap() call so that it occurs after the nodes are
  processed, so if a node build is necessitated, the blockmap gets rebuilt too.
- Fixed detection of empty rejects.
- Stopped loading REJECTs that are too small. They're probably caused by an
  outdated node build, so there contents are invalid and using them it is wrong.
- Added more checks for seg validity in P_LoadSegs().

July 2, 2003
- Removed the FROMCEILINGZ128 #define in p_local.h. I'm not sure what that was.
- Added support for properly tiling wall textures whose widths are not a power
  of 2.
- Fixed: Heretic and Hexen status bars' artifact flash effect was tied to the
  framerate instead of the ticrate.
- Changed the IMGZ loader so that it maps color 0 to 255 and color 255 to 254.
- Changed the cast finale so that it draws "our hero" using the player's suit
  color instead of the default green.
- Changed the BOSSBACK drawing so you can make it some size other than 320x200
  if you want.
- Moved StringWidth() out of DCanvas and into FFont, where it really belongs.

July 1, 2003
- Changed FPatchTexture::MakeTexture() so if it is loading a patch used by a
  decal it remaps color 255 to 254 rather than to whatever is the closest
  matching color in the palette. This is because decals are usually shade
  maps rather than paletted graphics, so changing color 255 to something
  in the middle of the palette looks bad. I also changed it so that it
  contstructs spans from the existing column data instead of rescanning the
  image for the transparent color, so it should be slightly faster, although
  it probably doesn't matter, since each patch will only be loaded at most
  once per level.
- Added a fix for sprites that have some, but not all, of their frames
  defined. I found this one when I tried to play Doom Raider. Ironically,
  it worked in 2.0.47 because I had a bug in the code that detected
  undefined frames. To fix, any undefined frames are made into copies of
  the first defined frame.

June 30, 2003
- Added a check to P_TestActivateLine() so that doors faster than 32 cannot
  be opened by monsters.
- Fixed: If only the right-most texture column of a wall is visible, the
  left-most texture column would be drawn instead.
- Added the ability for the SetFont ACS command to load normal pictures as
  fonts. When used this way, it creates a new font with only the letter A
  defined, and the letter A is drawn as whatever the picture is. This
  effectively allows you to use HudMessage like a HudPic command. The
  drawback to this method is that you cannot use any color translations, as
  you can with real fonts.

June 28, 2003
- Removed i_remapkeypad cvar. The keypad is now always considered separate
  from the main keyboard. This was really just something I had left over from
  the very early days of ZDoom before it even had Quake-style keybinding.
- Added prioritization of HUD messages. Lower-numbered IDs are drawn in front
  of higher-numbered IDs. An ID of -1 is identical to 0, except it gets drawn
  behind everything else.
- Made the puke console command work across the network.
- Fixed a crash bug in the node builder when the back side of a line
  shares endpoints with another seg, but the front side does not.
- Reimplemented texture warping for the new texture system. You should
  even be able to warp sprites if you make their widths and heights
  powers of 2, but I did not bother creating any such sprites to test
  with.
- Added another BOOM fix I just now became aware of: Donuts in Doom would start
  even if the pool sector was already moving. 

June 26, 2003
- Removed all the masked block functions, since they are no longer used.
- Changed fonts into collections of textures.
- Extended my CPUID code to gather more information.
- Spent enough time with a P4 to find out which of the vlinetallasm4
  routines works best with it. Answer: They are about the same, and both
  are about 20% slower than the Athlon version running on an Athlon.

June 25, 2003
- Moved all the self-modifying code out of the .data section and into the
  .rtext section. Unfortunately, NASM does not support creating writeable
  code sections (even though the object file format does support this), so
  I create them as regular read-only code sections in NASM and then modify
  them to be writeable using VirtualProtect() at run-time.
- Tried unrolling vlinetallasm4 to see if I could eek out some more
  performance from it. Unfortunately, it was slower at first and about the
  same at best, so I decided not to keep the unrolled version.

June 23, 2003
- Tried writing an optimized version of DFrameBuffer::CopyFromBuff() using
  prefetchnta and movntq, but it performed just as well as memcpy. Probably
  because video memory is much slower than system memory, so you don't really
  notice any of the inefficiencies of the rep movsd instruction that memcpy
  uses.
- Modified vlinetallasm4 slightly so that it executes in about 65%-81% of the
  time it used to take on my Athlon XP (depending on resolution) by reordering
  the instructions for parallelism. Note that this is the exact same
  optimization I tried earlier that reduced performance on a Pentium III-M.
  Also, the old version of the function still uses fewer cycles on a P3 than
  the new version uses on an Athlon XP. (7 cycles/pixel compared to 4.8
  cycles/pixel at 800x600). I am curious which version a Pentium 4 likes more.
  I will keep them both around and only select the new version for people with
  AMD processors belonging to family 6 or higher. The K6 might also like the
  Athlon version, but I don't have a K6 to test with, so I will leave it as
  it is now.

June 21, 2003
- Modified R_DrawColumnP_ASM() so that it has an alternate version of the
  inner loop without any writes to ch and hence, no partial register stalls.
- Removed the R_StretchColumn() function.
- Consolidated all the different patch drawing functions from DCanvas into a
  single DrawTexture() function. Amiga-style tag lists are used to pass it
  optional parameters to produce the same results as the old functions.

June 20, 2003
- Changed FImageCollection so that it is nothing more than an array of
  texture indices.

June 19, 2003
- Finished moving everything to the new texture system. There is still a
  little work yet to do, but at least the only place where patches are used
  any more is in the texture loaders.

June 13, 2003
- BTW, with the new texture system, you don't need to have every single texture
  defined in a single TEXTURE1 or TEXTURE2 lump. You do need to restrict
  yourself to just one TEXTURE1 and/or TEXTURE2 lump per wad, but they don't
  need to contain definitions for all the textures from the IWAD, since each
  wad's texture definitions are loaded separately.
- Fixed decals for the new texture system. 
- Added support for the rotation information Blood added to the art files.

June 12, 2003
- Changed screenshot capturing slightly so that it does not need to redraw the
  screen, so now it can capture the framerate in the corner.
- Added support for animating Build tiles.
- Added a new thing to use for spawning sprites in Build maps.
- Got sprites working with the new texture system.

June 11, 2003
- Fixed X-Y scale of Build maps. I had it twice as big as it should have been.
- Fixed the assembly slope drawer to work with non-square textures.

June 10, 2003
- After putting it off for far too long, I finally started working on a unified
  texture system that will let me treat sprites, flats, and wall textures all
  the same. Sprites are not done yet, but now Build maps can be viewed with
  the correct floors and ceilings. One consequence of this change is that flats
  are now stored in column-major format instead of row-major format, so I had
  to changed the span drawers to account for this.
- Added a new MAPINFO flag: NoInventoryBar - prevents the inventory bar from
  ever appearing in a Doom map. Also changed the Doom inventory bar so that it
  won't be drawn if you have no inventory items, even if you press the inventory
  selection keys.
- Changed PTR_UseTraverse() to continue traversal when a backward-facing line
  is encountered.

June 9, 2003
- Fixed: Batman Doom no longer crashes during the cast finale. 
- Made the texture error checking slightly more lax. It seems there is some tool
  that likes to write to unused areas of the texture directory meaninglessly.
- Fixed a prediction bug caused by moving between sectors with different friction
  levels. P_GetFriction() is sensitive to the ordering of the touching_sectorlist,
  so I need to preserve this ordering before and after prediction.

June 7, 2003
- Changed my transparent color from 0 to 255. An analysis of the original Doom,
  Heretic, and Hexen graphics revealed that this color was never used. It was
  probably going to be the transparent color before the Doom engine switched to
  using spans. But the real reason for the switch is because 255 is the color
  the Build engine uses for transparency, so I can draw its sprites without
  doing anything special.

June 6, 2003
- Made a slight fix to the frame interpolation: The time when the game tic is
  run is the base time I need to use for interpolation. Otherwise, the display
  could glitch if a tic passes between the time the gametic is run and the time
  it is displayed.
- Added a workaround for NT 4: Somebody goofed, and the default registry entry
  for CLSID_DirectInput under NT 4 has the wrong GUID. Two of the hexits are
  swapped so that it is stored in the registry as
  {25E609E0-B259-11CF-BFC7-444535540000} instead of as
  {25E609E0-B259-11CF-BFC7-444553540000}. You can fix this by running
  "regsvr32 dinput.dll" from a command prompt, or you can bypass it by loading
  dinput.dll and using DirectInputCreate to obtain an interface. Since I can't
  expect everybody running NT 4 to run regsvr32, I have to do the latter. :-(
- Fixed: Killing a morphed monster left an inert copy of the original monster
  around, so scripts that depended on being able to use thingcount() to determine
  when all the monsters of a certain type are dead would fail.
- Changed the Pig's and Chicken's MF_COUNTKILL bit to MF3_ISMONSTER, so morphing
  a monster does not add to the total number of monsters on the level.
- Fixed: FDoomStatusBar::DrawToSBar could create a partially transparent status
  bar because it left color 0 alone. I use color 0 as a transparent color for
  image blocks like this. (Though the status bar doesn't really need to be
  drawn with transparent parts, it was convenient to do it that way.)
- Changed the tid and TIDtoHate members of AActor from unsigned to signed, so
  that you can use negative tags with your teleporters.

June 2, 2003
- Fixed: Absolute lighting on walls was very dark. I don't think I have this
  feature accessable through Doom/Hexen maps, so you only notice it if you
  try to load a BUILD map.
- Added some command-line parameters to help make BUILD maps look better:
   -art   Specifies the directory with the TILESxxx.ART files.
   -bpal  Specifies the palette.dat file.
  So if I want to look at the Blood maps, I can do this:
   zdoom -art d:\games\blood -bpal d:\games\blood\palette.dat -file d:\games\blood\*.map
  (assuming that I have already extracted all the maps from the RFF file).
  Unfortunately, the tiles only show up on walls. I need to create a unified
  texture system so that wall textures and flats can be used identically.
- Fixed: Bots would only move on the arbitrator's computer in a net game.
- Fixed: If foggy and non-foggy areas were visible simultaneously, gun
  flashes would sometimes light the foggy area.
- Fixed: R_ResetViewInterpolation did not actually work.
- Fixed: Line-to-line teleporters did net reset the view interpolation.
- Fixed: The super-fast projectiles in Heretic and Hexen with custom Tickers
  did not update their previous positions, so they could not be interpolated
  correctly by the renderer.

May 31, 2003
- Added support for loading Blood maps. They are no more playable than
  normal BUILD maps, but since I can already load Blood sounds and BUILD maps,
  it seemed like the thing to do.
- Fixed: Loading BUILD maps was broken because they did not initialize
  sectors' ZoneNumber.
- Changed the default for vid_vsync from true to false, because with the
  unlimited framerate, no vsync actually produces better control.

May 30, 2003
- Added interpolation for moving polyobjects.
- Optimized SpawnPolyobj() and IterFindPolySegs() so that they are loads
  faster.

May 29, 2003
- Fixed Dehacked support for patches that swap sprite names instead of
  changing them to something completely new.
- Fixed the new net code to recover properly in situations where there is
  high packet loss. Except for one instance: If a player quits with -netmode
  1, and the packet with that quit notification gets dropped, it never gets
  sent again, so any players left will hang waiting for tic updates for a
  player who is no longer there.
- Rewrote D_ArbitrateNetStart() so that all data passes through the host.
  This should allow computers on separate networks to play together as long
  as they can all talk to the host and you use -netmode 1.
- Bumped BACKUPTICS up from 12 to 36.
- Finally finished decoupling -dup from the game ticker. Getting it to work
  without consistancy failures was a lot more work than I expected.
  Fortunately, I think it was worth it. I can notice little difference now
  between -dup 5 and no -dup (aka -dup 1). Before, doing that would take
  your framerate down to 7 FPS, rendering the game practically unplayable.

May 28, 2003
- Started decoupling -dup from the framerate.
- Fixed an obscure crash bug caused by drawing past the bottom of composite
  textures whose heights are not powers of 2. If the composite texture was
  constructed at the end of a page of memory, the game could read into the
  next page, which is bad if the next page is not mapped in.

May 27, 2003
- Framerates above 35 FPS should now be done. Whether or not it's good in a
  net game, I'm not sure, since they require rather precise timing to play
  smoothly.
- Added interpolation for every actor in the game, after I watched a rocket
  flying and it was obvious that its position was updating less often than
  the view.
- Added functions from BUILD for interpolating floor and ceiling movement.
- Added some view interpolation to allow frame rates above 35 FPS. It looks
  very nice (and playing at 35 FPS now looks very bad), _except_ it sometimes
  misses a tic so you get an annoying hiccup that is worse than just keeping
  things locked at 35 FPS. This is despite my sprinkling NetUpdate calls to
  some of the most frequently used rendering functions. [edit: It seems the
  hiccups were because I had a background program running; even at idle
  priority, it still stole a little time away from ZDoom every now and then.]

May 23, 2003
- Got a crash in R_SetWindow() when it was setting the value of the r_viewsize
  cvar. After recompiling with the _CRTDBG_CHECK_ALWAYS_DF flag, I could not
  reproduce it to find out why it happened. Poo.
- Added player movement prediction to make network games feel more responsive
  when gametic is lagging behind maketic. You can turn it off by setting
  cl_noprediction to true.
- Fixed: Using -extratic with the packet server crashed because it tried
  to send tic -1, which doesn't exist. I don't know why it didn't cause
  problems with the regular peer mode.
- Stopped using all named RNGs to check game consistancy. I have too many
  named ones that aren't all used in the gameplay loop. Now I just pick a
  few key RNGs and use those.
- Added another byte to the packets sent from the master to the slaves that
  contains the master's maketic. This is so that the slaves speed up or
  slow down to match the master instead of each other.

May 22, 2003
- Corrected my misunderstanding of how the frameskip array is used in
  d_net.cpp.
- I found out how to make three player games perform fine on XP: Set the
  processor scheduling back from "Background services" to "Programs".
  Here's a link to an article that explains the values for the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\PriorityControl\
  Win32PrioritySeparation key that this setting changes:
  <http://www.mcpmag.com/columns/article.asp?EditorialsID=405>. I think
  it's probably more the short time slices than anything else that makes
  it perform well. Why had I changed it from "Programs" in the first place?
  Because I was having trouble with background console programs sucking
  up all the CPU time, so I wanted to give everything equal time slices.
  I now have the registry key set to 0x20, which is short, fixed time slices.
  Not quite the same as the "Programs" setting. - Using the release build
  instead of the debug build obviously helps performance, too.

May 21, 2003
- Tried playing a multiplayer game on two machines for the first time in
  ages, and it went out of sync very quickly. It turns out that my laptop
  had genblockmap false, and my desktop had genblockmap true. Since this
  obviously makes it go out of sync, I'll have to make it a server var.
  Gennodes will need the same treatment, since it also implies genblockmap
  even if genblockmap is false. For ZDoomGL, however... I suppose I'll need
  to disable the blockmap regeneration if the nodes are only being built
  to get GL information.
- Wrote some code to let the net arbitrator function as a packet server. It
  makes everybody jerky, but that might just be because I'm running two
  clients on XP, and XP seems to do much worse at dividing processor time
  up equally between processes than NT 4. A two player game on one machine
  runs fine after a second or two, but three players is crap.
  [Okay, tried it on three separate machines, and it wasn't jerky, so that's
  a relief. Gametic was lagging behind maketic by 4 on the host, however, so
  it wasn't quite as responsive as I would have liked. That's opposite what
  I would have expected, since the host gets the ticcmds from the other
  players first. Maybe I need to investigate the code where it "speeds up
  time" some more. Or maybe I need to have the master send as many tics as
  it has for the other machines instead of the lowest common number of tics;
  e.g. If it has 1 tic from one machine and 2 tics from another, it should
  send all of them to a third machine instead of just 1 tic each from the
  first two machines. For comparison, a 2 player game (which is effectively
  always peer-to-peer even with packet server turned on), had gametic lag
  behind maketic by 2.]
- Removed the names from these RNGs: pr_chainwiggle, pr_afx, pr_decal, and
  pr_decalchoice. I don't know why it happens, but they can sometimes
  disagree with each other in a network game, particularly pr_decal. Since
  they don't have any real impact on game sync, removing their names keeps
  them from affecting the sync check, but it also means they won't be
  remembered across save games.
- Added DEM_EMPTYUSERCMD so that if a player's input doesn't change from one
  tic to the next, I can save one byte in the network packet. That makes the
  minimum packet size for one tic 5 bytes: 2 for the header, 2 for
  consistancy, and 1 for the tic itself. I'd call that a big improvement over
  the previous minimum size of 14 bytes (8 header, 2 to hold the list of
  players in that packet, 2 for consistancy, and 2 for the tic).
- Fixed: Damaging a monster would not reset its threshold value, so it would
  be more willing to switch targets than it should have been.
- Changed AActor::StaticSpawn() to not initialize the LastLook member for
  non-monsters. This caused the game to go out of sync when non-essential
  actors were spawned on one machine and not another (e.g. decals and bot
  aiming helpers).

May 20, 2003
- Beefed up the consistancy checking so that it now considers more than just
  the players' X positions.

May 19, 2003
- Optimized the size of the network packets some. The minimum header size is
  now 2 bytes instead of 10. Note that I removed the checksum from the header.
  The network transport should already be doing error checking and not provide
  us with any corrupt packets. In the highly unlikely event that somebody ports
  this back to DOS, they'll need to add a checksum in there. Also made some
  corrections to the packets that get sent around before the game begins.

May 16, 2003
- Made active powerup colors customizable via dehacked misc section.
- Changed the netbuffer checksum to use CRC32 (which gets used like a CRC28
  because the top 4 bits are chopped off to make room for some command bits).
  I could probably get rid of the checksum entirely, since UDP packets
  already include their own checksum field.
- Fixed: When one player in a network game unexpectedly quit, everybody else
  would bomb out with ECONNRESET. Now the i_net.cpp code pretends that those
  players sent out NCMD_EXIT packets. Why a connectionless protocol like UDP
  would return a connection-oriented error code, I do not know.
- Starting a network game with the -join parameter before the host started
  would fail with ECONNRESET. This is no longer an error, so you don't
  need to start the host first anymore.
- Added MF2_NOTELEPORT to TeleportFog.

May 5, 2003
- Fixed: P_Move() used the actor's default speed instead of the actor's
  speed.

May 2, 2003
- Added mousewheel support to the console.

April 26, 2003
- Uploaded 2.0.47.
- Added support for custom episode definitions (for all games, not just
  those that are already divided into episodes).
- Fixed: Doom Shareware does not have an ENDPIC graphic, so don't try to
  show it.
- Added a visible inventory bar for Doom.

April 25, 2003
- Added APROP_Ambush for Set/GetActorProperty.
- Added myasctime() function, which is equivalent to
  asctime(localtime(&time(NULL))), except it doesn't crash when the current
  time is before Jan 1, 1970 (which makes localtime return NULL).

April 20, 2003
- Added a NULL file check to M_NotifyNewSave(). I was sent a crash report
  where this appears to have been the cause.
- Fixed: Using teleporters with actor hits ceiling/floor triggers was
  problematic because the actor would still be clipped to its new ceiling
  or floor even if the teleport made it unnecessary
- Finished Thing_ProjectileIntercept so that it works in three dimensions.
  Big thanks to all those on the notgod phorum who helped me with the math.

April 16, 2003
- Extended my speedup trick for 1024x768 so that it also gets used for
  2048x1536 and 512x384. I can now play the beginning of MAP01 in 2048x1536
  at ~28 fps instead of 14 fps. 512x384 is so small that it doesn't really
  matter, but I think it is a few tenths of a millisecond faster now. What
  I think is going on: If the screen's pitch is a power of 2, then drawing
  columns (which Doom does a lot of in its renderer unless you're looking at
  the floor) will flush the cache lines a bunch and bring performance
  plummetting, as it has to transfer much more data to and from main memory.
  By making the pitch slightly larger so that it isn't a power of 2, the
  cache gets utilized better, so performance goes up.
- Started adding Thing_ProjectileIntercept special (175). It is identical to
  Thing_ProjectileAimed, except it leads the target.
- Fixed: Activating SoundEnvironment actors did not work, because I forgot
  to include the AActor * parameter in the prototypes.

April 14, 2003
- Uploaded 2.0.46.
- Added support for adding new projectiles to DECORATE.
- Changed the summon cheat so that it can be used to shoot projectiles
  and not just spawn them in place.
- Made the Lost Souls spawned by Pain Elementals inherit the Pain
  Elementals' hate information.
- Fixed the poison dart's poison application.
- Added a NULL-actor check to P_DisconnectEffect(), because I received a
  crash log where it was called with a NULL actor.

April 12, 2003
- Fixed: The calulation of secplane_t::ic was different in p_setup.cpp's
  slope spawners than it was in secplane_t's serializer, so if a demo was
  made on a level with slopes, and the game was saved during the course of
  the demo, the demo would desync if the player went on a slope after the
  save.
- Fixed: If a DirectInput 8 interface could not be obtained, the game would
  hang while trying to read mouse input using the DirectInput 3 interface.
  This is because DI8 has a DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA structure that is 4 bytes
  larger than DI3's. Unfortunately, IDirectInputDevice::GetDeviceData() does
  not do anything useful when passed a structure larger than it recognizes.
  It leaves the buffer alone, does not touch *pdwInOut, and returns DI_OK,
  which is quite misleading. I had to step into DirectInput before I
  realized what was going on, although I could have also discovered it by
  browsing dinput.h more thoroughly.

April 11, 2003
- Moved joystick reading out of I_GetEvent() and into I_StartFrame(). That's
  where it was in the original DOS Doom, because reading a traditional
  gameport can be an expensive operation (though I think USB is much faster).

April 9, 2003
- note to self: Remove BOOGA s
- Fixed: Thing_Projectile2 wasn't shifting the zspeed over.
- Fixed: The slopes created with P_SetSlope() had their orientations inverted.
- Time to upload 2.0.45.
- Made "cyborg" a synonym for the "other" gender, for compatibility reasons.
- Fixed: Forget "== 0" after stricmp (Line1, "No Ice Death").

April 8, 2003
- Uploaded 2.0.44.
- Changed A_FreezeDeathChunks() to not use S_FREETARGMOBJ. It just destroys
  the actor instead. I should probably get rid of S_FREETARGMOBJ globally,
  since it isn't really needed with my stale pointer cleanup code.
- Fixed lockups caused by changing the TID of an actor stored in another
  actor's LastLook member because of Thing_Hate.
- Made MF4_NOICEDEATH accessible through Dehacked as "No Ice Death".
- Added "No Autofreeze" as a misc Dehacked setting.
- Fixed the "Entering Unnamed" text that could be seen when finishing a game.
- Fixed: Frozen things could not be shattered with radius damage, because the
  thrust they got after the damage would reset their tic counters to 3 seconds.
- New: The marines now start with the same sprite scaling as the player, and
  AScriptedMarine::SetSprite() now copies the scaling of the actor it's taking
  the new sprite from.
- Added some code to check for fake floor/ceiling sector actions when an actor
  moves up or down because of moving floors and ceilings.
- Fixed: SetActorProperty for APROP_Health assumed you were working with
  players after I added the player fix for it.
- Fixed: The plasma ball still had MF2_ICEDAMAGE from my testing.
- Fixed: Gender selection in the menu was broken because I had changed to
  "cyborg" to "other" in m_menu.cpp but not in d_netinfo.cpp. Justification:
  You can have male and female cyborgs, so cyborg isn't a proper gender.
- Some files were missing from the VC6 and Dev-C++ projects, so fixed that.

April 7, 2003
- Uploaded 2.0.43.
- Fixed incorrect end-of-LevelInfos detection. Interestingly, it only crashed
  when compiled with GCC.
- Updated the crash logger to display the exception information for an
  access violation.
- Added Thing_Projectile2 ACS command. It's mostly a clone of the
  Thing_Projectile and Thing_ProjectileGravity specials, but it lets you give
  the projectile a TID.
- Added a newtid parameter to the Thing_ProjectileAimed special.
- Fixed flat warping so that it does not crash with flats smaller than 64x64.
- Fixed: The secondary frost shards shed by the mage's primary frost missile
  could damage the player who shot them.
- Made the randomization of the starting tic count for missiles an actor flag.
  This is so that Heretic and Hexen missiles can be better used in a Doom game.

April 6, 2003
- Added a check for NULL players to DCajunMaster::WhatToGet() because I got
  a bug report where that happened.
- Fixed: MF3_NOTARGET only worked if the attackers's TID was non-0 or you used
  Thing_Hate on the target.
- Fixed: The Heretic staff was able to damage ghost enemies, which it
  isn't supposed to be able to do.
- Fixed: In their charge attack, Minotaurs could only do damage to other
  monsters and not to players.

April 5, 2003
- Created a minimal FLAC distribution with just the parts ZDoom needs to
  compile, so the lazy people who want to build don't need to grab the
  library themselves.
- Changed A_FreezeDeathChunks() so that it spawns more ice chunks for large
  things than it does for small things.
- Added a generic ice death, so things can turn to ice and shatter without
  having a specific ice death. Now you can use bex to create a Doom missile
  that does ice damage and watch Hexen's cool ice death.
- Fixed: Radius damage did more thrust as your distance from the bomb
  source increased.

April 2, 2003
- Changed ripper projectiles to do damage per-tic and not per-step. This is
  more intuitive and also makes for better Heretic/Hexen compatibility,
  since those games don't adjust the step count with projectile size (unless
  the radius > 15, but none of their ripping projectiles are that big).
- Fixed some weirdness that can happen when the listener is positioned
  directly on a sound source in 3D sound mode by moving the listener
  back slightly from its true location. It was especially pronounced with
  the nForce but can also be heard with the Audigy depending on the
  environment settings.
- Fixed: Sector sounds always played at Z coordinate 0, so they weren't
  always audible when using 3D sound.
- Added all the EAX presets from UT2003 and verified that the SNDEAX parser
  actually works. Also tweaked the EAX editor a bit.
  
April 1, 2003
- Updated to FMOD 3.62.
- Fixed: Loading more than one dehacked patch (through some means other
  than an include statement) that altered state information would not work
  because only the first one would be able to find the correct locations
  of the original numbered states.

March 31, 2003
- Fixed: PCD_PRINTNAME with input values 1 through 8 did not work properly.

March 29, 2003
- Added support for normal, buring, and frozen deaths to decorations. Still
  need to test these.
- Changed P_SeekerMissile() to aim at the center of targets when seeking
  vertically, rather than at the targets' feet.
- Fixed: MF_ICECORPSE was not being set when things froze to death.
- Changed DCanvas::TextSWrapper() so that it can draw characters that are
  clipped, since that was fixed in the underlying block drawers a long
  time ago.
- Fixed: V_BreakLines() crashed if it encountered a character wider than the
  width of the box used to break the text in.

March 27, 2003
- Added support for playing SLIGE-generated maps without running them through
  a node builder first.

March 26, 2003
- Added support for FLAC music and sounds. See <http://flac.sourceforge.net>
  for more information about what FLAC is. Since it's a lossless codec, I
  don't really want to see people using it for music, but the option is
  there none-the-less. All the sounds in zdoom.wad (sans DSEMPTY) have now
  been compressed using FLAC.
- Added a fix for fonts that contain color 255 in their glyphs. LWM had some
  fonts like this, and it counts as a bug in imagetool (which I have now
  fixed).

March 22, 2003
- Made more flags available to decorations.

March 21, 2003
- Added Alt-Enter as a hotkey for toggling between fullscreen and windowed
  modes, as is customary for Windows programs. Also discovered that I can't
  seem to run fullscreen through the debugger anymore without the game
  window minimizing. [Must have been something screwy going on then; I can
  run it fullscreen under the debugger now.]
- Revamped the joystick menu to support axis mapping and multiple controllers.
  Under Windows versions that send DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED broadcasts, it even
  updates itself automatically when you attach/detach USB controllers.
- Changed MF2_REFLECTIVE behavior so that missiles also get reflected
  vertically.
- Changed all the weapon state functions' prototyes from (player_t*, pspdef_t*)
  to (AActor*, pspdef_t*). Now they have the same first parameter as the
  standard state functions, so bex/dehacked patches should be able to use the
  standard code pointers with players, so long as they don't need a target
  or something similar that player's don't maintain. It also means that weapon
  functions that do very generic things like just playing a sound should work
  with non-weapons.
- Changed AActor::UpdateWaterLevel to accurately reflect when a player's eyes
  are underwater.
- Made setslot usable from KEYCONF lumps.

March 19, 2003
- Updated the joystick code to use DirectInput instead of the old multimedia
  system.
- Removed dxcrap.cpp. I am linking with dinput(8).lib again.
- Fixed: If Trace() did not hit a wall in a sector with a fake floor before
  the trace ran out, it would not set CrossedWater even if the trace crossed
  below the fake floor.
- Altered P_LineAttack() so that it doesn't spawn bullet puffs on lines
  using the Line_Horizon special.

March 17, 2003
- Added a check for a NULL lastenemy in A_LightningClip() because Mike B. had
  a crash where this was NULL.
- Gave the fist and chainsaw AmmoUse values of 1, so dehacked patches that make
  them ammo-using will use ammo without needing to specify a new AmmoUse.
- Added new sound sequences for the Heretic doors, because they don't have the
  same sound usage as Doom's.
- Fixed: The powered-up phoenix rod would use ammo when a Tome of Power ran out
  and infinite ammo was enabled.
- Added SpawnPoint initialization to AActor::StaticSpawn(), so things that get
  spawned during the game can respawn someplace other than (0,0).
- Changed projectile impact lines so that the projectile's owner activates the
  script instead of the projectile itself. Projectile cross lines will still be
  activated by the projectile.
- Fixed: The window drew over the video window when WM_PAINT was received while
  playing a movie in windowed mode.
- Fixed: Closing the window while a movie was playing would close the window
  without quitting the game.
- Fixed: Fake inventory items cleared their special after being picked up.
- Added support for setting the player's speed using SetActorProperty()
  and APROP_Speed. This speed gets multiplied to the player's normal
  speed.
- Changed A_BrainSpit() so that it does not rely on a pointer to the
  DBrainState in the BrainEye that calls it. This allows it to be used
  by actors other than the eye, which is necessary because of Dehacked.

March 13, 2003
- Fixed: Loading a FON2 font without a space or N character would read
  (essentially) undefined memory when calculating the width to use for the
  space character.

March 11, 2003
- Removed the old midiStream-based code.
- Wrote a SNDEAX lump parser.
- Fixed: Aliases defined in KEYCONF lumps were still saved to the ini. They
  could also override aliases stored in the ini. Now, if an alias is defined
  in a KEYCONF, it will not be saved to the ini, and if there is an alias with
  the same name already defined in the ini, the original alias will be kept in
  the ini when you quit.

March 10, 2003
- Fixed: Defining an animation for a non-existant texture could stomp on memory.
- Added support for different sound zones with individual EAX settings. To assign
  sectors to different zones, you either make them physically unconnected or you
  use a Line_SetIdentification with the second parameter set to 1.
- Fixed: Changed FindLevelByWarpTrans() search order to return later warptrans
  matches in favor of earlier ones, so you can start Hexen DK with the menu
  again.
- Fixed: AZShrub2::GetExplodeParms() and AZXmasTree::GetExplodeParms() were
  mis-named and had the wrong prototypes, so they were never called.
- Added a hack when playing Hexen so that the BLANK texture is permanently mapped
  to the empty texture. The standard Hexen maps use it as an empty texture,
  even though it isn't really empty.

March 8, 2003
- Changed sprite initialization so that TNT1 is always the first sprite. This
  is what I wanted a long time ago, and I think it used to be like this but
  got changed when I rearranged the sprite table initialization.
- Changed the TID target search so that it looks for actors in the same block
  before it searches the actor chains. Helm's Deep's AI seems a bit quicker once
  things get going now, but there are still bits of architecture (lots of masked
  mid textures) that are going to slow it down, and it's still slow at the
  beginning and when the second wave starts moving.

February 24, 2003
- Decided to take up the challenge and figure out how to load Strife textures.
  It looks like they just removed some unused fields from the texture
  directory. Now you can actually load strife1.wad and look at the maps, but
  there are still plenty of oportunities to make it crash if you try to use
  it as an iwad.
- Added a check for negative texture patchcounts to R_InitTextures(), just
  for the people who try to use -iwad strife1.wad.
- Fixed: The game would hang when trying to overwrite an read-only savegame
  for the same reason it used to hang when playing back a save operation
  recorded in a demo: The save itself was cancelled, but the request to save
  was not cancelled, so it would endlessly try to save the game.
- Fixed: P_BounceWall() would bounce every bounce type off of walls, but it
  shouldn't have done anything for MT2_HERETICBOUNCE.

February 18, 2003
- Changed: P_RadiusAttack no longer tries to apply damage when distance is 0.

February 15, 2003
- Changed P_SetSlope() to scale by ANGLE_90 instead of ANGLE_180. Silly me;
  Scale() works with signed ints, but ANGLE_180 is to big for that, so it
  could overflow.

Feburary 13, 2003
- Changed: When locating a map by its warptrans number fails, it can now try
  to locate it by map number instead. Apparently, an old version of the Hexen
  demo did not have warptrans.

February 12, 2003
- 2.0.42 time.
- Fixed: If weapon drop was on and a player respawned before their body went
  nonblocking, they wouldn't actually drop a weapon.
- Dehacked compatibility fix: MF3_ISMONSTER now copies the state of
  MF_COUNTKILL for any actors that get patched.
- BOOM compatibility fix: Lines with a type of 0 still need their ID set to
  their tag. P:AR's rotating light on E1M1 requires this for the teleport line
  its voodoo doll uses.
- Added code to set the MIDI output device's volume to full for devices that
  support it. That makes the full range of volumes available without having
  to set the volume with the Windows mixer. 
- Fixed: The GiveInventory command would give one inventory item if the amount
  was 0.
- Fixed: Inventory items that were not present in a savegame were not reset to
  0 when the savegame was loaded.

February 10, 2003
- Added wildcard support to the cmdlist and cvarlist commands, so you can look
  at just a subset of the lists.
- Fixed: The total monster count reset when loading saved games so that it would
  no longer include monsters that spawned after the start of the level.
- Uploaded 2.0.41.
- Fixed: When a MIDI or MUS song stopped because it reached the end of the song
  (if it was nonlooping), the midiOut device would not be released.
- Removed the DirectMusic MIDI option because it wasn't working, and Timidity++
  is a better sounding solution if you can't do hardware wavetable MIDI.
- Fixed: ProduceMIDI() crashed because it had the wrong header check.
- Fixed looping problems with the new MUS player because I accidentally moved
  some code in the wrong place. The new MUS and MIDI players also had semi-
  random default channel volumes for the same reason.

February 8, 2003
- Uploaded 2.0.40.
- Added support for Apogee's EMIDI controllers.

February 7, 2003
- Wrote new MUS and MIDI player routines that do not use MIDI streams. Instead,
  they use a time critical thread and midiOutShortMsg to send MIDI messages to
  the playback device. I have not tried this with a lesser OS like Win98, so I
  hope it works okay there. I want to remove the old player code so I that I
  just have one method to use for playing MIDI data. This approach offers two
  advantages over the stream method as it was employed: 1) Minimal setup time,
  so music changes can happen faster. 2) Volume support for everything that
  supports channel volume controllers, which is everything I tried. I think I
  might also add support for the Apogee Sound System's EMIDI files just because
  I have some docs for it.

February 6, 2003
- Added mouse and joystick option menus. Also added an option not to
  prescale the mouse movements. I've done this all along because it
  feels like the vertical sensitivity is much higher than the horizontal
  sensitivity, so the prescaling compensates for that perceived difference.
  But it could be the reason some people gripe that "ZDoom's mouse feels
  different from Doom's! It sux0rz delux0rz!" So now they can turn it off
  with a single switch instead of messing with the various mouse sensitivities
  to decompensate.
- Fixed: The game did not give up the mouse if use_mouse was false.
- Changed the default ID for lines without a Line_SetIdentification or
  similar special to -1 instead of 0. This is so that you can use
  Line_SetIdentification to give a line ID 0 and still tell it apart
  from all the other lines on the map without IDs. This emulates standard
  Hexen behavior and also fixes a bug on caldera.wad, MAP10 where almost
  every line on the map would get set to a switch texture right after
  you entered it.
- Added support for Hexen's warptrans mapinfo command. I see now that it
  gets used to determine which map you start on for a new game.
- Changed MAPINFO parsing so that maps named ExMy will automatically get
  their levelnum set to xy unless you specify something different. MAPxx
  maps were already getting this treatment.
- Added a syntax error message if you don't specify a valid keyword for a
  block in ANIMDEFS.
- Added a non-player check to the A_DoomSkinCheck and A_HereticSkinCheck
  functions. I guess if somebody uses Dehacked to assign the player death
  states to something else, they could get called by something that isn't
  a player.

February 5, 2003
- Changed A_KeenDie() to search among whatever called it and not exclusively
  among Keens.
  
February 4, 2003
- I can now build a fully working version of ZDoom with MinGW. Perheps now it
  is time for me to turn my attention back to Linux.

February 3, 2003
- Fixed a stupid bug I added to the tl_tab calculations in fmopl.cpp.
- Fixed: Monsters that hated both players and monsters would crash if there
  was more than one player in the game.
- It's 2003 now, isn't it?

February 2, 2003
- Uploaded 39.cab.
- Fixed: Dormant actors still bled.
- Added a PatrolSpecial actor (doomednum 9047). It works like
  InterpolationSpecial, but for PatrolPoints instead of InterpolationPoints:
  When a monster reaches a PatrolPoint, it will execute the specials of any
  PatrolSpecials with the same TID as that PatrolPoint.
- Added a new ACS command: SetMarineSprite (tid, "otherClass"); You give it
  TID of the marine(s) to change and the name of an actor class to get the
  sprite from.

February 1, 2003
- Fixed a Heretic/Hexen bug: Actors with a crash state would not crash if
  they died on the ground.
- Changed I_InitInput to request a DirectInput 3 interface instead of
  whatever the header specifies. It should work with NT 4 again, now.
- Added checks to the marines' attacks to prevent crashes if their targets
  unexpectedly disappear.
- Fixed: Monsters could start targetting themselves if they blew up a
  nearby barrel (or pod).
- Changed A_VileAttack() so that the Archvile can't hurt itself with its
  own fire.
- Fixed: In Hexen you can queue scripts for maps on other hubs. They don't
  get cleared along with the world variables, as I had mistakenly believed.

January 31, 2003
- Removed the need to press D to set the default resolution at the video
  modes menu. This seemed to be a common point of confusion (despite having
  the directions right there in the menu), but more importantly it makes the
  menu fit on one screen when using 9 pixels per row of text instead of 8.
  Heretic and Hexen both look better with 9 pixels of room rather than 8.
- Fixed: Scrolling up past the top of the menu was hard-coded to assume
  the Doom font when finding the bottom of a menu, so it didn't work
  correctly for Heretic or Hexen.
- Fixed: When pressing up arrow to scroll the top of a menu, its scrollpos
  could get set to -1.
- Removed the limit on the number of frames that can assigned to an
  animation sequence with ANIMDEFS.

January 30, 2003
- Fixed: The old Thing_Hate behavior no longer worked.
- Added the Thing_ChangeTID(oldtid, newtid) special to change the TID of
  anything with oldtid to newtid. If oldtid is zero, then whatever activates
  it gets its TID changed to newtid.
- Added the ActivatorTID() ACS command to retrieve the TID of the actor
  that activated a script.
- Added the PlayerNumber() ACS command for finding out which player is
  executing a script. Returns 0-7 for an actual player and -1 for
  anything else.
- At GooberMan's request, added bool as a synonym for int to ACC.
- Added support for a KEYCONF lump. This is a limited console script that
  can only execute the commands alias, defaultbind, addkeysection,
  addmenukey, weaponsection, and addslotdefault. Now a wad with custom
  key and weapon bindings doesn't need a separate .cfg file to operate.
- Added weaponsection console command for specifying that the weapon slot
  assignments go to some ini section other than the default.
- Fixed: Processing an ACS object's MINI chunk initialized one map variable
  too many.
- Fixed: Map variables that were not stored in a savegame were not
  zero'd when the game was loaded.
- Changed: Include directives in Dehacked patches will now look for the
  specified file in the same directory as the patch they are used from
  before they look in the current directory.

January 29, 2003
- Changed: Just loading a game is no longer enough to assign a quicksave
  slot. You need to either save a game or quickload first.
- New: The pullin command now looks for wads in the same directory as the
  script that executed it before it looks for them in the current directory.
- Fixed: Switch definitions in ANIMDEFS with an on state that ends on the same
  texture it began on would crash instead of properly detecting the error
  and quitting with a useful error message.
- Changed: Voodoo dolls no longer affect a player's deltaviewheight.
- Changed: Voodoo dolls can now be pushed around by damage even when the
  player is invulnerable.
- Fixed a bug in P_DamageMobj() I introduced after some reformatting that
  prevented voodoo dolls from being pushed around.
- Changed the final output of the OPL2 synth to look like this:
      final_output = (chip_output * 1.5) - 18000
  This is because most of the instruments the Doom games use create
  waveforms that are primarily located in the upper half of the wave.
  (Because, of the four basic waveforms of the OPL2, all but one of them
  only use the upper half of a sine wave.)
- Fixed the assembly part of OPLmusicBlock::ServiceStream() to work with
  odd-sized buffers.
- Fixed: When the player does not have the invisibility power active, the
  weapon would always be drawn with STYLE_Normal instead of whatever style
  the player had.
- Added the cleric and mage Icon of the Defender behavior.

January 27, 2003
- Fixed the finetuning of double-voice OPL2 instruments, so now the Heretic
  musics don't sound like crap.
- Changed the OPL2 emulator to write data to the output buffer a voice at a
  time instead of a sample at a time. The speedup isn't as great as I would
  have liked, but it does let me avoid doing work for voices that aren't
  playing anything, and it should make it easier to optimize in the future.
- Just a note: I think the OPL2 outputs samples at ~49716 Hz.
- Removed the x2 amplification from fmopl2.c's output, because some of the
  Heretic songs made it overflow. Looking at sampled output however, it seems
  most of the data is going only into the positive half of the wave, so perhaps
  I could subtract some constant from the data and keep the amplification.
- Reduced the length of the OPL stream so that it gets filled fourteen times
  each second, so that it interrupts the main thread more consistantly and
  has less of an impact on the game's "smoothness".

January 25, 2003
- Changed the frequency calculations in the OPL2 player to match DMX's (or
  so I think).
- Fixed an amplitude problem with the OPL2 synth I inadvertantly introduced
  while trying to optimize it.

January 24, 2003
- Uploaded 38.cab.
- Added a fix to prevent you from becoming a zombie player when there are
  voodoo dolls on a level, and each accumulates enough damage to kill you,
  but none of the dolls receives enough damage individually to die.
- Changed monster patrols so that when a monster reaches the end of a path,
  it looks in the same direction as the final patrol point.
- Fixed: PIT_RadiusAttack() ignored MF2_NODMGTHRUST, so Hexen's poison cloud
  would push things away from it. I also used this to determine if that
  function will spray blood splats, but perhaps a poison damage flag would
  be better?
- Added the ACS commands SetPlayerProperty and GetPlayerProperty.
- Added different versions of the scripted marine that each use a different
  weapon. There's also an ACS command to let you change their weapons at
  any time.

January 23, 2003
- Added some more Thing_Hate types that can be used to make monsters that hunt
  both monsters and players or to ignore players that attack them.
- Made Bishops spawned by Heresiarchs and Wizards spawned by D'Sparil inherit
  their masters' hate preferences.
- Made Heresiarchs and Bishops ignore each other. I didn't check if this was
  original Hexen behavior or not, but it seems stupid for a Heresiarch to kill
  a Bishop it just summoned simply because the Bishop happened to hit it.
- Added a new invisible thing (#9076) that you can make monsters attack using
  Thing_Hate. It's probably best to place this next to something solid, since
  it blocks projectiles (including the player's) and affects the player's aim.
  The angle you give it determines how much health it has, 1 degree is 10 hit
  points, 2 degrees is 20 hit points, etc. Give it an angle of 0, and it never
  dies. The angle field is used for this instead of one of the argument fields
  so that it can still execute a death special.
- Fixed: P_NightmareRespawn() assigned the old body's spawn parameters to the
  teleport flash instead of to the new body, so when the new body respawned,
  it would respawn at (0,0) instead of its original location. Also set the
  respawn chance back to ~1.6% instead of the 100% I had been using earlier
  for testing.

January 22, 2003
- Uploaded 37.cab.
- Played with A_Chase() a bit more so that monsters that hate monster groups
  will look for closer monsters on their way to a monster they can't see.

January 21, 2003
- Improved Thing_Hate with a third parameter. Now we have Thing_Hate (tid1,
  tid2, type). If type is 0, it behaves just like before: Everything with tid1
  chases after the first thing with tid2 and then promptly forgets their hate
  once that thing dies. Set it to 1, and it's much like normal except instead
  of looking for players everything with tid1 looks for something with tid2.
  And if type is 2, it's just like type 1, except the monsters with tid1 don't
  actually need to see any monsters with tid2 before they start chasing after
  them, so it's somewhat closer to type 0 than type 1 is.
- Changed Hexen player jumping velocities from 9 to 9.75 because they weren't
  jumping as high as they should have been, even though 9 is the value Hexen
  uses. The 9.75 was arrived at by playing Hexen.exe, standing next to a wall
  to see how far up the texture the player gets when he jumps, and then
  tweaking until ZDoom was approximately the same. It is enough, at least, to
  make the clock gear in hexdd MAP57 accessible without the Wings of Wrath.

January 20, 2003
- Fixed: Dormant monsters should not enter their SeeState when Thing_Hate is
  used on them.
- Fixed: In Hexen, the Wings of Wrath do not expire at all in single player
  games. I had erroneously believed that landing on the ground would
  temporarily halt their timer until you started flying again (which is
  incorrect).
- Fixed: At the easiest difficulty, P_DamageMobj halves damage. If the damage
  was one, it would become zero. Now if the damage is one, it stays one.

January 18, 2003
- Added a PointerSubstitution() method to DObject to replace all pointers
  to one object with pointers to another object. This is so that when
  something morhps or unmorphs, enemies targetting that actor will be
  targetting the correct actor instead of the stale one.
- Added: In Heretic, killing a player as a chicken turns you into a
  "super chicken." ZDoom was missing this.
- Removed the redundant P_HealRadius() function.
- Fixed: Palette remapping isn't enough to make Doom skins work with Heretic
  because the two games also use different death animations.
- Fixed: The Icon of the Defender gave the name of the Ring of Invincibility
  when it was picked up.
- Fixed: The warp console command crashed if you didn't specify enough
  parameters.
- Added means-of-death as a third parameter to Thing_Damage.
- Fixed: Items that had been dehacked would not have their MF_DROPPED bit set.
- Added a ShouldStay() method to ADehackedPickup() so that it can get
  rerouted to the real pickup.
- Fixed: Single player demos played back with different RNG seeds than they
  were recorded with.

January 16, 2003
- Fixed assignment of partner segs in FNodeBuilder::FixSplitSharers().

January 14, 2003
- Added NULL-actor checks to P_CheckSight().

January 13, 2003
- Fixed: Advancing to a new level would subtract the number of live monsters
  on the old level from the total number of monsters on the new level.
- Fixed: The game tried to play the hall music when doing non-Hexen endings.
- Added world and global arrays for ACS. They are somewhat different from
  map arrays: They are one-dimensional and you don't specify a size when
  you declare them. Instead, they grow as-needed during normal use.
- Removed sp from DLevelScript, because the stack pointer is always 0 when
  RunScript() returns.
- Fixed: PCD_INCMAPARRAY and PCD_DECMAPARRAY used the wrong stack value for
  the array index.

January 11, 2003
- Assigned spawnid 154 to the Baron's fireball (to be added as T_BARONBALL
  to zdefs.acs).

January 10, 2003
- Changed sectorsound to use CHAN_AUTO instead of CHAN_BODY. Otherwise, not
  all the Hexen "puzzle" switches sound right.
- Fixed: The STREAM_ENUM macro in a_artifacts.h used call-by-value instead of
  call-by-reference, so artifact types could be written to an archive, but
  they couldn't be read back from it.
- Removed inventorySlotNum, as it was unused.
- Fixed: Reading strings with FArchive would never return NULL, and it left
  copies of all the strings read behind in memory.
- Fixed: When sprites were renumbered in a recompile, the sprite scanner in
  FArchive would find matching-named skin sprites instead of the real sprites.
- Added a "vapor" SaveVersion 205. This is a version 204 save written by
  versions 2.0.33-2.0.36 because arti_pork was added in 2.0.33 and I did not
  bump the version. There will be no savegames that are actually written as
  version 205, because I changed the way artifacts are saved so I won't have
  to worry about this particular problem again in the future.
- Uploaded 36.cab.
- Added a new player property for ACS (PROP_TOTALLYFROZEN #4). When active, it
  won't let the player do anything but press +use, which is what PROP_FROZEN
  was really supposed to be.
- Added MF_NOLIFTDROP flag for no-gravity things that should not move down
  with lifts if they are standing on the lift. This is only used with the
  various bridge actors because various ZDoom maps break if they move with the
  lift, and the Hexen bridge has visual glitches if it moves so I doubt
  anybody used this Hexen behavior.
- Got rid of the orbit table for Hexen's bridge balls. Now they move every tic
  instead of every fifth tic and use the finecosine/finesine tables directly.
- Fixed: When a monster was spawned through a script but there was no room
  for it, it would still count toward the total monsters on the level.
- Fixed: P_Thing_Spawn() set MF2_PASSMOBJ for flags instead of flags2, so it
  was really setting MF_NOCLIP, and the P_TestMobjLocation() check would
  always succeed.

January 9, 2003
- Added a new player property for ACS (PROP_FLY #3).
- Added a level flag to set monster death special behavior to the Hexen mode:
  The things that die activate the specials; not the things that kill them.
  You can use MAPINFO to turn this off in Hexen and turn it on in Heretic/Doom.
- Fixed: The Heresiarch used its death inflictor instead of itself as the
  activator of its death script.
- Fixed: DLevelScript did not have its activator member recorded in its list
  of object pointers.
- Fixed: Saving a game in a demo would cause the program to hang when that
  point was reached in the demo.
- Made the game recover from failures during dearchiving thinkers so that
  you can actually do more stuff without it crashing. Just needed to add
  a try/catch block so that it can undo what was done before it failed.
- Added the -savedir option to specify where savegames are stored.
- Fixed a bug in PIT_FindFloorCeiling(): It used tmthing even though
  P_FindFloorCeiling() didn't set it.

January 8, 2003
- Fixed: The hexen main menu showed the spinning skulls from Heretic instead
  of the fire bulls.

January 7, 2003
- Uploaded 35.cab.
- Fixed the node builder to successfully create GL nodes with >64k segs.
- And now the node builder is fixed point again. (Undo is nice.) Making it
  exclusively floating point made vrack2big3's BSP take 10 seconds longer to
  build. Since the goal was to avoid the cost of int-to-float conversions
  every time PointOnSide was called, I'd say it backfired miserably. With just
  the change to PointOnSide, it's only about 1 second slower than 2.0.34.
- Okay, the node builder now uses floating point for all its calculations.
- Changed FNodeBuilder::PointOnSide() to use floating point to avoid overflow.
  Methinks I should just change the node builder to use floating point
  exclusively. Then it won't have to do int-to-float calculations repeatedly.
- Changed A_Tracer() to set the puff type before it calls A_SpawnPuff().
- Fixed: P_RecursiveSound crashed if it encountered a line that was marked
  two-sided but lacked a second side.
- Fixed: The cursor in the Advanced Sound Options menu started one line too
  high.
- Added Hexen support to giveinventory/takeinventory/checkinventory and made
  them work with cross-game items.
- Fixed: Clock gear 3's inventory image was misspelled as ARLTIGER3.

January 4, 2003
- Fixed: findFreeChannel() in mlopl.cpp would try very high channels instead
  of the correct ones and access undefined memory.
- Fixed: The Thing_Spawn special would fail to spawn things without
  MF2_PASSMOBJ set if there was something already occuping their x,y space,
  whatever that thing's z coordinate. This was problematic with the Hexen
  bridges.
- Fixed: DDrawFB::PaintToWindow() can get called during the render process
  when a WM_PAINT message is received. If the framebuffer was already locked,
  this would overwrite the buffer pointer and pitch with those of the
  physical screen. This is not normally a problem, but one way to get a
  repeatable crash was to turn on any of the pixel doubling modes and switch
  from fullscreen to windowed. Simple fix: PaintToWindow() does nothing if
  the screen has a non-zero LockCount, and Update() zeros LockCount before
  it calls PaintToWindow().

January 3, 2003
- Uploaded 34.cab.
- Added a parameter to AActor::LinkToWorld() to tell it to use the original
  incorrect point-on-line side calculations of the Doom engine. This is just
  so that the map spots in the emerald key room of Hexen MAP01 will spawn in
  their intended sector and not the sector that is technically correct.
- Added a new compatibility option: compat_usewallblocking. Now I see that
  there are wads that used non-use lines to block the player from activating
  a use line.
- Changed AActor::StaticSpawn() again. When spawning map things, the floor
  and ceiling z's are taken from the actor's center point. When spawning
  things during gameplay, the true z's are found instead. So P:AR's player
  starts are still working, non-players placed in the map will be able to
  get stuck in the floor of a neighboring sector, and anything spawned
  during the game with ACS (or otherwise) will have the "correct" behavior
  and know what their true floor and ceiling z range is. TBD: Should this
  be players-only? Decided: Yes, otherwise bullet puffs will appear on
  window sills instead of the actual spot where the bullet hit.
- Changed P_FindFloorCeiling() to use different global variables than
  P_CheckPosition(), because it can be called within P_CheckPosition().
  Doom has too many global variables for its physics code.

January 2, 2003
- Uploaded 33.cab.
- Fixed A_RestoreSpecialPosition() for MF2_FLOATBOB actors.
- Fixed: Made the porkalator and morph ovum separate artifacts.
- Fixed: In Heretic and Hexen, MF2_FLOATBOB objects are always positioned
  relative to the floor. In ZDoom, they bob around a central z height, so
  they need to have gravity applied to them in order to best approximate
  the orginal behavior.
- Created a new function (P_FindFloorCeiling) to find the floor and ceiling
  for newly-spawned things. P_CheckPosition() has side effects, so I can't
  use it. This is also used by P_TeleportMove() now.
- Uploaded 32.cab.
- Fixed: EV_DoCeiling() only set the crush value for the moving ceiling if it
  had a crushing type, so BOOM generalized ceilings could not do crushing
  damage.
- More GCC 3.2 cleanup. Everything compiles now--except for zdoom.rc. Windres
  can't handle it so I had to settle with a precompiled version.
- Split off the system-specific code from w_wad.cpp into i_wad.cpp.
- Changed AActor::StaticSpawn() so that it uses P_CheckPosition() to get the
  real floorz and ceilingz to use in case the actor overlaps a line.
- Gave the fatso's fireball spawnid 153. In zdefs.acs, T_CACODEMONSHOT was
  incorrectly named T_MANCUBUSSHOT.
- Created one-parameter version of the W_MapLump functions that return pointers
  to const data so that the compiler can be issue warnings if they get assigned
  to non-const pointers.
- Added MF2_PUSHWALL to all the Heretic monsters.
- Put back MF2_PASSMOBJ because of the unexpected consequence removing it had:
  Overlapping things would push each other to the ceiling. This was most
  visible with the invisible bridges, which people have commonly overlapped.
  I have taken a different approach to the situation that caused me to remove
  it: Now you can't push anything without MF2_PASSMOBJ while riding a lift.

January 1, 2003
- Uploaded 30.cab. I hope I didn't break anything I haven't already caught by
  getting rid of the zone heap and switching to memory-mapped files.
- Made more input cvars global config (such as m_pitch and m_yaw).
- Changed the sound rolloff factors for Heretic and Hexen.
- Fixed: Unlike Doom and Heretic, Hexen crushers do not continue to move if
  there is something being crushed underneath them. Instead, they wait for the
  thing underneath to either die or move out of the way. The crushing pillars
  you find the first time you visit Hexen MAP03 do not actually kill you if
  they don't wait for you to die before fully closing.
- Added support for "fake" lumps so that the music system can continue to play
  on-disk music files without having to include them on the command line with
  -file. These "fake" lumps are automatically unmapped when they are done being
  used so that their memory can be decommitted, but their file handles remain
  open because I don't want to deal with also removing lumps at runtime.

December 31, 2002
- Changed FRandom::StaticClearRandom() so that different seeds produce more
  disparate results in the different RNGs.
- Fixed: FRandom::StaticClearRandom() was not being called after rngseed was
  set at game startup.
- Changed the wad loader to use memory mapped files, so now I have better
  caching than what the zone heap could hope for, since the VM system does all
  the work for me.
- Added a fixup in R_InitTextures() for the Doom E1 sky, which has its patch's
  y origin at -8 instead of 0.
- Added the F_EndFinale() function to clean up after the finale is over, since
  I can't let the zone heap do it automatically anymore.

December 30, 2002
- Removed the zone heap. Everything is done using new/delete and malloc/free
  now, so you don't have to worry about specifying a heap large enough.
- Fixed: The [.NetServerInfo] ini sections were still read in single player
  games.
- Fixed: The player class filter in P_SpawnMapThing() used SinglePlayerClass[]
  instead of player_t::CurrentPlayerClass.
- Put the FMUSIC loader back the way it was so that MODs in WADs work again.
- Changed EV_Teleport() so that if it can't find any teleport destinations,
  it looks for a matching map spot instead. This fixes the southern teleporter
  in Hexen MAP10.
- Added MF3_DONTMORPH to the Hexen boss monsters.
- Removed MF2_PASSMOBJ flag and made it standard behavior for all actors
  because of a test map I received: If an actor with MF2_PASSMOBJ rides up
  a lift underneath a non-MF2_PASSMOBJ actor, the top actor would fall inside
  of the bottom one once the lift stops.

December 28, 2002
- Changed the nodebuilder timer to use I_MSTime() instead of clock/unclock,
  because very large maps can make it exceed the 32-bit resolution of
  the clock/unclock macros.
- Uploaded 29.cab.
- Moved the R_ClearParticles() call out of G_InitNew() and into P_SetupLevel().
- Experimented with the 3D sound parameters to find a rolloff factor that
  best approximates the software sound.
- Updated to FMOD 3.61.
- Fixed: S_UpdateSounds() still multiplied the SoundCurve volume by 2, so
  things decayed twice as quickly as they should have. I would like to get
  rid of the SoundCurve use, but I'm not sure how Raven modelled the curve
  for Heretic and Hexen.

December 27, 2002
- Fixed: The FireDemon could not be perceived to move except when strafing
  because it still used PROP_SpeedLong instead of PROP_SpeedFixed. Because
  this was the only place where PROP_SpeedLong was used, I got rid of it.

December 26, 2002
- Changed the internal subsector_t struct to use 32 bits to keep track of
  segs instead of 16, and fixed the node builder up so that it works with
  >64k segs.
- Changed the internal node_t struct to allow for more than 32768 subsectors
  and nodes.
- Fixed: The fighter played PlayerFighterGrunt instead of FighterGrunt on his
  third punch because I didn't realize the two sounds had different names.
- Changed PIT_FloorDrop() to more accurately reflect Hexen's behavior. Things
  under gravity move down with the floor if the floor moves fewer than 9 units
  in one tic (not 24), and no-gravity things always move down with the floor
  (no matter how fast it drops) if they were standing on it.
- Changed forwardmove and sidemove scaling calculations in P_MovePlayer()
  so that they won't overflow.
- Changed server vars so that only compatflags and forcewater are archived.

December 24, 2002
- Fixed: Autosave still worked when the player was dead.
- Fixed: The Quietus pieces had the wrong spawnids, so they were overriding
  the stained glass shards. I'm not sure why they had the wrong numbers.
- Fixed: AZWingedStatueNoSkull and AZGemPedestal had their see and melee
  states swapped, so they wouldn't change their appearance when activated.
- Uploaded 28.cab.
- Fixed: When "Monsters Ignore Each Other" was set, monsters could not be
  hurt by ACS-spawned projectiles.
- Fixed: Underwater reverb did not work on Audigies anymore because FMOD was
  only reporting them as supporting EAX3 reverb and not also EAX2 reverb.
- Fixed: Empty console command lines are not added to the history list.
- Added a new ini section so that select ServerInfo cvars can be remembered
  across games. There is a different one for single player games and for net
  games, and the net game version is only saved on the machine that acts as
  host.
- Added useflechette command, which acts like "use ArtiPoisonBag1,2,or3"
  depending on the player that uses it.
- Moved the default +showscores key in Hexen to Scroll Lock, because \ is
  already used by "use ArtiHealth".
- Added the Hexen default keys for quick-use of inventory items.
- Added addslotdefault command to only put a weapon in a slot if it isn't
  already assigned to a slot.
- Changed P_FindNamedInventory() to use the same names as the actors that
  represent the inventory items, for consistancy.
- Gave the pod and explosive barrel MF3_DONTGIB flags so that if 
- Changed the setslot and addslot commands so that you cannot have more than
  one copy of a weapon in a single slot.

December 23, 2002
- Did some cleanup for GCC 3.2.
- Added a fix for wads that have things like FF_END immediately followed by
  F_END.
  
December 22, 2002
- Fixed: ThrustFloorUp and ThrustFloorDown did not have spawnids, nor did they
  override Activate() and Deactivate().
- Fixed: P_LoadBuildMap() read numsectors out of the Build map before checking
  to make sure there was actually enough data for numsectors to be present.

December 21, 2002
- Changed pointer tracking in pointy classes to use pointers to members instead
  of offsetof, as per GCC 3.2's suggestion.

December 20, 2002
- Turned the vertex and linedef indices in the map data structures into
  unsigned words. Everything compiled without warning, so maybe big level
  support really is that easy.
- Fixed: Maps with >32k unpacked sidedefs could not be loaded because
  sidei_t::a.map in p_setup.cpp was still signed.
- Changed: REJECT lumps with 0 length won't even be loaded now. And REJECTs
  that have some length but are nothing but 0s will be freed.
- Fixed: The sprintf in the first case of D_WriteUserInfoStrings() had an
  extra comma, so it would crash, making demo recording impossible.
- Fixed: DArgs::CheckValue() did not check to ensure that value is valid.
  (That is, that it does not begin with + or -).
- Fixed: Trying to add more bots than there are starts in a coop game would
  leave the extra bots as "active", so you could not spawn them even after
  removing the existing bots.
- Fixed: Players could not choose their weapons if they loaded a savegame
  before starting a new game because weapon assignments were only transmitted
  at the start of a new game.
- Added separate translation tables for the player corpses so that when a
  player dies and comes back with a sprite that uses a different palette
  translation range (i.e. a mage dies and is reincarnated as a fighter),
  the corpse will retain the translation the player had at death. This also
  means you can't change the color of your corpses anymore.

December 19, 2002
- Uploaded 27.cab.
- Fixed: The internal node builder was not setting bPolySeg, so segs would
  be randomly marked as belonging to polyobjects if you used the internal
  node builder.
- Uploaded 26.cab.
- Fixed: TELEFOGHEIGHT was not being used everywhere it needed to be.
- Changed: P_DropItem() uses the standard Doom drop for items that don't
  have gravity (such as the Mage's lightning weapon).
- Changed: Dying puts you into chasecam mode.
- Fixed: The fighter's axe and hammer could not be picked up for mana by the
  other classes.
- Moved the assignment to waitingforspawn inside SpawnBot() past the checks
  to see if any bots are left to spawn.

December 18, 2002
- Fixed the "give armor" cheat for Hexen.
- Added artifacts and puzzlepieces as categories for the give cheat.
- Replaced Killough's blockmap builder with the one I had written for ZDBSP.
  The MBF one was found to be incorrect near vertex 0 of Doom's E3M6. There
  are probably other problem spots, but that's the one that was first
  noticed.
- Fixed: Hexen_sbar.cpp had WPIECEM1 misspelled as WPEICEM1, so the top
  part of the Bloodscourge would not appear in the status bar until you had
  the complete weapon, which causes a different graphic to be drawn.
- Fixed the elusive hub crashing bug introduced by my November 26 but/hub
  "fix". Parsing of NEW_PLR_OBJ and NEW_PLR_CLS_OBJ when m_HubTravel is
  true would wait until the object had been parsed before mapping it to
  an index. It needs to be mapped immediately after being created so that
  any references to it in its stored data will actually refer to it and
  not the next object in line.
- Fixed P_SetSectorFriction() so that using a friction amount of 100
  calculates the standard movefactor 2048 instead of 255.
- Changed Sector_SetFriction so that when it's used from a script, it will
  clear and set the sector's friction flag as needed.
- Fixed: The fighter's axe and hammer would still use mana when infinite
  ammo was turned on.
- Fixed: P_SpawnPlayerMissile spawned missiles with a facing direction
  slightly to the right of their real direction when there were no monsters
  for it to autoaim at. Among other things, this made the frost cone fire
  right of center.
- Fixed: Picking up a flechette would only give you the fighter's variety
  because I forgot to uncomment some code after adding the other two player
  classes.

December 13, 2002
- Uploaded 25.cab.
- Added a hack for 256-tall textures with patches that mark their post
  lengths as 0. This lets pleiades.wad and its skies work.
- Multiplied the output of the OPL chips by two so that they aren't so
  quiet.
- Gave opl_onechip a callback so that changes to it can take effect
  immediately.
- Fixed: findFreeChannel() in mlopl.cpp could crash when going from two
  chips to one, because it did not reset the value of last.

December 12, 2002
- Fixed an original Hexen bug: EV_RotatePoly() set the first polyobject's
  special data to a rotator, then it created a new rotator and assigned it
  to the mirror polyobject's specialdata, and then it also assigned the
  second rotator to the first polyobject. This left the first rotator
  forgotten, and if a player got in the way of one of the polyobjects so
  the other one destroyed the rotator, it could crash.
- Uploaded 24.cab. Why cab? Because LZX compression is better than ZIP, and
  I'm stuck uploading files with a 56k modem. That's why. The source code
  archive alone is almost 700k smaller as a cab than as a zip. That's at
  least four or five fewer minutes that I need to wait uploading it.
- Fixed: Bloodscourge projectiles would not pass through non-boss monsters
  because AMageStaffFX2::SpecialMissileHit() was incomplete. It is a much
  more dangerous weapon now.
- Fixed: ACircleFlame needed a GetExplodeParms() member function so that it
  would do the correct damage and not harm the player.
- Uploaded 23.cab.
- Fixed: Dehacked weapon patches did not set the new FWeaponInfo::givingammo
  field.

December 10, 2002
- Uploaded 22.cab.
- Fixed: If you had a bot with you in a co-op game and you switched levels,
  the bot would come with you as normal, and it would also spawn a new copy
  of itself later, so you would now have two bots instead of one.
- Moved the player name display for spying up slightly so that it isn't
  obscured by the Hexen status bar.
- Added support for terrain-defined friction, so the Hexen ice flat can
  behave like ice.
- Fixed: Weapon pieces were not behaving like weapons with sv_weaponstay on.
- Fixed: The spinning invulnerability and maulator icons that appear at the
  top of the screen when they are active were not right-aligned.
- Fixed: The maulator artifact had the wrong status bar image.
- Fixed: Using Dragon Skin Bracers to get more than 100% armor would mess
  up the armor display in Hexen's automap status bar.
- Now I know why I didn't direct hudmessage and print commands to the
  screen of spying players. Changed it back to the way it used to be, so
  it doesn't pay attention to the player's camera when deciding whether it
  should take effect or not. One solution for this would be to have
  separate status bars for each player and just route the messages to the
  appropriate status bars. Probably too much effort at this point.
- Fixed: The player faces showed up on the scoreboard even when not playing
  Hexen.
- Fixed: The extralight from your gunshots would be used if you weren't
  looking through the eyes of a player.
- Uploaded 21.cab.
- Fixed an accidental problem when travelling between levels because
  I mis-blocked some code in WI_End().
- Fixed: Using a flat as an intermission background instead of a full
  graphic would not print any text.
- Fixed: FWeaponSlots::StreamInSlots() only cleared the even slots,
  so weapnext/weapprev failed, and weapon selection in odd slots would
  work wrong.

December 9, 2002
- Fixed: Dormant monsters would respawn when monster respawning is
  enabled, losing their dormant state and any specials they were given.
- You can spy through your teammates' eyes in deathmatch now, and you
  can also see them on the automap.
- Added face icons to the Hexen scoreboard.
- Gave the bots some minor knowledge of Hexen weapons.
- Fixed: The fighter would not get any mana when he picked up his axe
  or hammer.
- Added the Hexen finale and intermission screens.

December 6, 2002
- Removed M_PBOX from zdoom.wad. M_DrawFrame() draws the box around the
  player in the menu now, since it works with all games and not just Doom.
- Added some more choices to the sound options menu.
- Added support for setting player sounds by their real names in skins
  (i.e. *xdeath instead of pspdiehi), and added a few more sound mappings
  for the Legacy names.
- Added simple palette remapping for skins so that Doom skins can be used
  while playing Heretic.

December 2, 2002
- Added software OPL2-synthesis for MUS music in order to mimic "the
  good old days." I haven't had a soundcard with an OPL chip in six years,
  so I don't know how accurate the sound is, but I think it's reasonable.
  Pity it takes around 10% of the CPU time on my Athlon XP 1600 (at 44.1 KHz).
  The MUS player part of it comes from Vladimir Arnost's MUS Lib, and the
  OPL2 part of it is from MAME.

November 28, 2002
- Fixed the player setup menu to work with scaled sprites, and added an
  option to skins so you can set the scale for more than just the base
  sprite.
- Gave each player their own set of weapon slots, so custom slots can be
  used in net games and demo playback.
- Added player translations for Hexen.
- Added player class filtering for the Hexen fourth weapon pieces.

November 26, 2002
- Added player class filtering for the Hexen weapons.
- Added the "Healing Radius" artifact.
- Fixed a hub travel bug when playing with bots. If there were more bots
  in the level being travelled to than the one travelling from, the load
  would fail.
- Fixed: ASorcBall::Serialize() did not call its super method.
- Fixed a hub travel bug introduced by the version tracking code:
  SaveVersion would not be set before a game was actually saved or loaded,
  so snapshots would not load back properly until that happened. Another
  related problem is that somebody could load an old savegame with
  multiple snapshots and then save it again without revisiting all the
  snapshots. Thus, a savegame could have snapshots created with different
  versions of the game, so each snapshot needs to carry version information
  around with it.

November 25, 2002
- Changed the ACS print and hudmessage commands so that if a projectile
  activates a script, they will print to the screen of whoever fired the
  projectile instead of failing because the projectiles don't have a screen.
  Also changed them so that they show up for anybody spying on the person
  who activated the script.
- Added the pig.
- Disabled skins in Hexen, and changed the player setup menu to show class
  instead of skin when playing Hexen.
- Added "random" as a choice in the Hexen class/new-game menu.
- Fixed: p_GiveArmor() gave the negative value of the desired armor, which is
  effectively the same as always giving blue armor.
- Fixed the weapon slots so that they can accurately determine if a weapon
  using both types of mana can be selected.

November 23, 2002
- Put Hexen's new game menus in place, although you still can't select a
  player class.
- Disabled blood splats for players using the god mode cheat.
- Added palette flashes for Hexen's poison and ice damage and the Wraithverge
  and Bloodscourge.
- Added the Bloodscourge and Wraithverge.
- Changed sound loading to use the heap instead of zone memory, so large sounds
  can be used (although it's probably a bad idea nonetheless). Also added a
  fallback mechanism so that sounds that are too big for hardware buffers will
  be created in software instead.
- Fixed the Doom status bar so that removing a key from the player's inventory
  will remove the key from the status bar without having to manually hide the
  status bar first.
- Added FloorClip as a property for use with DECORATE.

November 22, 2002
- Added WAVE loading to the alternate mixer.

November 21, 2002
- Added an alternate sound mixer that bypasses FMOD and and does all the sound
  mixing itself, feeding it to a DirectSound buffer directly. This is not
  meant to be a complete replacement for FMOD, so it's pretty basic. It's not
  even particularly optimized. I only wrote it in the hope that it alleviates
  the BSODs a very few people got without -nosound.

November 19, 2002
- Changed ThrustThing to mimic the original P_XYMovement() MAXMOVE clamping.
  Setting the third parameter 1 will let you use any thrust you want.
- Put back the maxmove restriction for underwater actors, but it should
  probably be handled differently.
- Fixed: Respawning in single player would execute respawn scripts instead of
  enter scripts, and travelling to a new map without being dead would not
  execute respawn or enter scripts.
- Fixed: Only the first entry in each DECORATE lump would be processed.
- Fixed P_XYMovement() so that startx, starty, onestepx, and onestepy are
  properly recalculated after sliding along a wall. This seems to have fixed
  the ability to go through walls at corners when moving very quickly. I hope
  there aren't any other bugs lurking in there.
- Fixed recording of compressed demos: The demobodyspot and democompspot
  pointers were not being moved when demobuffer would get realloced, so
  replacing the BODY chunk with compressed data would stomp on invalid memory.
- Fixed: P_SlideMove()'s stairstep case still used mo->momx instead of tryx.
- Fixed G_QueueBody() and the pointer cleanup in dobject.cpp so that it
  doesn't try to destroy bodies that were already destroyed outside of
  that function (such as by a crusher squishing the body).

November 15, 2002
- Added the Quietus.

November 13, 2002
- Hexen has a status bar now.

November 9, 2002
- Changed CheckIfExitIsGood() so that dead players cannot exit a level.
- Fixed: The ThrustThing special is supposed to add to the actor's velocity,
  not set it.

November 8, 2002
- Imported the node builder fix that splits segs collinear with a splitter
  with any events they cross. This is only necessary for bad maps that have
  overlapping linedefs.
- Changed dehacked text replacement so that if a pickup sprite's name is
  changed, the identification map used by DehackedPickup is also updated.
  This lets you pick up Strain's shotgun, plasma rifle, and BFG replacements.
- Changed bot_observer mode so that it does not set the player's MF_SHADOW
  bit.
- Changed P_LookForPlayer() so that it does not "find" players without the
  MF_SHOOTABLE bit set.
- Added floorclip adjustments for sectors that have their floorpics changed
  or move their floors.
- Fixed floorclipping so that it chops off the same amount of space for all
  vertical sprite scales (as opposed to chopping off x rows from the bottom
  of the source sprite).

November 6, 2002
- Removed the menu title graphics from zdoom.wad because they can just be
  drawn using BigFont.
- Moved "Player Setup" into the options menu and removed the last vestiges
  of the old fire effect for that menu.
- Extralights don't work with the release build. Oh well.
- #if-ed out the decal-out-of-range code again, because I think it should
  finally be fixed thanks to the recent changes to PrepWall.
- Made some changes to allow for loading earlier format savegames. Right now,
  that means ZDOOMSAVE200 games can still be loaded. Earlier versions won't be
  supported.
- Added Dehacked Gravity and LowGravity code pointers.
- Made demo_compress a global config cvar.
- Changed the ini's location to be "$PROGDIR/zdoom-$USERNAME.ini" because
  some people have multiple copies of ZDoom installed in different directories
  for different IWADs, and they might want to use different configs with them.
- Fixed sector triangle finding for area-less sectors.

November 4, 2002
- Added more correctness checks to PrepWall() and PrepLWall() to check for
  out-of-bounds texture columns. The very-near-a-decal-crashing problem should
  be solved now.

November 2, 2002
- Restored the menu_gameplay command I had accidentally removed.

October 31, 2002
- Added a check to A_Lower() to ensure that the pendingweapon is not
  wp_nochange.
- Fixed: The ACS SetWeapon command checked if there was enough weapon to use
  the current weapon, not the one being switched to.
- Fixed: The FFont* serializer could only use already loaded fonts. It could
  not load any new ones, so some FFont pointers could be initialized to NULL
  after reloading a savegame from a previous session.

October 30, 2002
- Merged the separate floorcolormap and ceilingcolormap sector members back
  into a single ColorMap member.
- "3D lights" can color floors and ceilings now.

October 29, 2002
- Decided to do something fun, so I added support for rendering "3D lights"
  on walls.
- Changed HealThing special so that it does nothing if the actor's health
  is already above the specified maximum.
- Fixed: The eyes crossing fake floor/ceiling special actions were only
  checked when moving vertically. They also need to be implemented for
  horizontal movement in case the fake floor/ceiling is sloped.

October 23, 2002
- Fixed: The MF3_GHOST flag was not cleared when the invisibility
  artifact wore off.

October 21, 2002
- Added Ceiling_Waggle as special 38.
- Added a check for a 0 maxmove to P_XYMovement() because P_DoCrunch() sets
  the gib's radius to 0.

October 15, 2002
- Restored the old x2 calculation in R_ProjectSprite and changed the
  iscale calculation so that it is based on the x1, x2 values instead of
  the inverse of xscale.

October 14, 2002
- Reenabled the error check in WallSpriteColumn() because it seems it can
  still happen. Now it has a bunch more debug spew and exits with
  I_FatalError().
- Changed the x2 calculation in R_ProjectSprite() because the old method
  could cause a sprite to be drawn one pixel too wide under rare
  circumstances.
- Fixed: R_ProjectSprite() did not add one to thing->xscale.
- Added a check to the node builder for maps without any lines so that
  it can exit gracefully instead of crashing.
- Made Sector_SetFriction work from inside scripts.
- Changed Floor_RaiseByValueTxTy so that if it isn't activated by a line,
  the target's sector type is set to 0, and its floor is left alone. This
  should be much better than crashing.

October 12, 2002
- Imported all the changes from the standalone node builder to increase
  accuracy and add support for GL nodes.

October 10, 2002
- Fixed the ordering of the WTSRegisterSessionNotification call so that it
  (again) occurs after the window is created, so the message loop can
  actually receive the messages.
- Replaced the %p and %I64x format specifiers I was using in i_crash.cpp to
  equivalent %x replacements, because the Windows 9x version of wsprintf
  does not understand them.
- Made MinotaurSpecial, DSparilSpecial, IronlichSpecial, and
  SpecialAction_KillMonsters accessable through MAPINFO.
- Changed message handling in P_CheckKeys() so that the correct Heretic key
  messages will show up even if you don't flag the keys as "either will do"--
  a rather pointless thing for Heretic since it only has three unique keys.

October 1, 2002
- Fixed a bug in P_XYMovement() that could cause you to move exponentially
  faster when running on a slope along a wall.

September 30, 2002
- Fixed the Doom status bar so that the ouch face will show up when it was
  intended to.

September 27, 2002
- Removed Infight from DehInfo so that monster infighting can be completely
  controlled by the cvar.

September 26, 2002
- Fixed FDoomEdMap so that it works with negative thing numbers without
  crashing.
- Fixed dehacked text substitution trying to compare against a null music name
  in the predefined mapinfos.
- Fixed "Monster Ignore Each Other" infighting mode so that player projectiles
  can damage monsters.
- Changed P_SlideMove so that it can use the smaller steps from
  P_XYMovement, so if something is moving very fast and slides along the wall,
  it shouldn't be able to pass right through small obstacles next to the wall.
- Fixed: If a move was split into multiple steps and you went through a
  teleporter, the remainder of the move would still be executed from your
  original position, rendering the teleport useless.

September 21, 2002
- Played around with a 140 Hz TICRATE for a while. The high framerate was
  nice, but there are too many places that implicitly depend on a 35 Hz TICRATE
  (physics in particular) for me to try and truly fix the game for variable
  TICRATEs before a final release.
- Removed the unused P_CalcSwing() function and its related global variables.

September 18, 2002
- Fixed the use of seg grouping in the node builder so it actually works as
  intended. The mechanism GroupSegPlanes() uses to group segs was also
  changed before I discovered the real problem with it: SelectSplitter()
  was using r = pseg->planenum & 7; instead of r = 1 << (pseg->planenum & 7);
  The new grouping scheme may not have been necessary, but it should be
  faster at least.

September 17, 2002
- Removed playernumber from DCajunMaster. The only time it was used for
  something non-local was in the ThinkForMove method, but its use there
  was inconsistant with its other uses. Apparently, ThinkForMove expected it
  to be the maximum player number plus one, but SpawnBot stored the most
  recently spawned bot there instead. This could crash ThinkForMove if
  the most recent bot spawned was player 0. Replacing its use in ThinkForMove
  with MAXPLAYERS seems acceptable.

September 14, 2002
- Added optional logging of ACS hud messages.
- Upped the number of local script variables to 20 to match ACC 1.25.

September 12, 2002
- Changed ACS function importing so that imported functions cannot be
  "chained" from one library to the next.
- Added code to properly tag string arrays.
- Fixed a hang that could occur when importing ACS arrays.
- Added a little more information to the crash report.
- Changed WndProc so that it only resets the language if the WM_SETTINGCHANGE
  message was sent as the result of a locale change.
- Figured out how to make the crash collector work with secondary threads:
  Using an UnhandledExceptionFilter, the information for that thread is
  collected, the thread is put to sleep, and an APC is queued on the primary
  thread. Once the APC executes, it raises a software exception that gets
  caught by the outer-most __try block, and the primary thread shuts down
  and shows the crash dialog. I think it would be better if I could raise
  exceptions in any thread I wanted, but this will suffice. As long as
  I_GetEvent() is called often enough to put the thread in an alertable state
  using SleepEx, the APC should be able to execute without much delay.

September 11, 2002
- Finished the crash information collection code.

September 9, 2002
- Changed "give armor" cheat to give armor equivalent to blue armor, even when
  Dehacked is used to modify the blue AC.

September 7, 2002
- Fixed: Imported libraries had their source libraries recorded wrong.

September 5, 2002
- Fixed hud messages so that they restore the screen's previous font instead
  of always assuming the previous font was "SmallFont".
- Changed the node builder so that segs with the same front and back sector
  can be a part of a subsector with segs from a different sector. Although the
  result is not a proper subsector, it is okay because such segs can only add
  masked mid textures to the scene, and those use the seg (not the subsector) to
  find out which sector they belong to. This fixes the area by the fence in
  tqtrust MAP04 when the internal node builder is used.
- Changed PTR_SlideTraverse so that blocking two-sided lines are treated like
  one-sided lines.
- Fixed the nodebuilder so it works again without crashing.
- Fixed: ExtractFileBase did not understand files with a drive specifier but
  no path. i.e. It would consider the base file name for d:myfile.foo as
  d:myfile and not myfile.

September 3, 2002
- Changed the "This map has errors that must be fixed" message to be more
  specific about what exactly needs to be fixed.
- Made MDK work only in non-deathmatch games, even if sv_cheats is true.
- Added the following contributions from Stevie-O:
  + Fixed: AImpactDecal::CloneSelf() would cause ImpactCount accounting to mess
    up if the clone had to be destroyed because it hit the sv_maxdecals limit.
  + Fixed: Using MDK cheat would print blank lines to the console.
  + Fixed: Respawning monsters could spawn inside other things because
    P_NightmareRespawn() was not changed to account for thing-over-thing.
  + Fixed: Telefragged players would still show the FX_RESPAWNINVUL effect if
    it was active when they died.
  + When bot_observer is true, players can no longer fire their weapons.
  + Added sv_fastweapons cvar.

September 2, 2002
- Fixed: New-style behavior lumps without any scripts would crash the game.

August 31, 2002
- Made R_InitTextures more forgiving of errors.
- Changed DrawWrapper to clip columns to the patch's height. This "fixes"
  malgnant.wad's corrupt titlepic that crashed the game.

August 26, 2002
- Added a workaround to the DObject::DestroyScan()s because the bglobal object
  is not showing up in the Objects list.
- Added whereisini command to make finding the .ini easier for users.
- Removed MBF torque simulation. It made the corpses fall off the bridge
  at the beginning of the Hexen MAP40, and it was also responsible for the
  "boogying" chaingunners in the last room of Doom2 MAP22. I haven't checked
  MBF to see if they do it in MAP22 there too, but I thought it best just
  to remove it, since it was causing so many reports of anomalies--enough
  reports that I probably copied something wrong. Okay, checking MAP22 with
  PrBoom, the chaingunners do slide perpetually but nowhere near as bad as
  they were doing with ZDoom before.
- Fixed: After drawing the underwater scene after Heretic E2M8, the normal
  game palette was not being restored.
- Changed ASoundWaterfall's gametype from Raven to just Heretic. Although it
  exists in Hexen, it cannot be spawned in a map because of conflicting
  doomednums.
- Removed Linux -cdrom support because it's not needed.
- Used the new run-time subclassing abilities to add support for pickup items
  that are identified by sprite instead of by class. For it to work, a
  dehacked patch needs to modify an actor (in any way) with the pickup flag.
  Any pickup items touched like this will cause a new class to be derived
  from DehackedPickup. This class will clone the defaults of the original
  actor, and the original actor will be modified so that it does nothing
  but spawn the clone. DehackedPickup implements the functionality to spawn
  a copy of the desired item just long enough to pick it up.
- Changed DDrawFB::LockSurf so that it retries the resource creation
  multiple times if the error DDERR_UNSUPPORTEDMODE is returned (presumably
  because the NT Security dialog was opened and then closed).
- Added a check for players without bodies to R_SetupFrame(). This should
  never happen during normal play, but a dehacked patch could cause it to
  happen.

August 23, 2002
- Added a console warning when multiple actors try to map to the same
  doomednum.
- Removed Printf_Bold. Use Printf with a level of PRINT_BOLD instead. The
  result is exactly the same.
- Fixed a demo sync bug. When the user alt-tabs away, the game is paused,
  but the demo continues playing anyway. The fix is to change G_Ticker() so
  that if the game is paused, and the demo didn't do it, don't fetch more
  tic commands from the demo until the game becomes unpaused. Unfortunately,
  hitting a breakpoint in debug mode will still mess up demo playback, so
  I avoid pausing the game at all when the window is deactivated and a
  demo is playing if _DEBUG is defined.
- Fixed: When a multi-step move is blocked in P_XYMovement, the move needs
  to actually stop right away. This seems to be what caused wallrunning: In
  the first step, the player hit the wall, so his movement got clipped to it.
  In the next step, the player would continue in his original direction and
  travel further along the wall. Since I know what causes wall running now,
  I added the compat_wallrun cvar to enable it as desired.
- Reduced maxmove in P_XYMovement from (mo->radius*2 - FRACUNIT) to just
  mo->radius. This brings back wallrunning (unexpected), but I'm hoping it
  stops things shooting through walls when they're very fast. The original
  maxmove I chose seems quite high. I don't know why I did that.
- Changed Megasphere back to being pickup-able even when you're already full
  on health and armor.
- Fixed: Automap powerup did nothing.

August 22, 2002
- Fixed: Heretic's gauntlets are supposed to have their kickback set to 0 so
  that they don't push monsters away.
- Updated the source for FMOD 3.60: Changed FSOUND_Sample_SetLoopMode to
  FSOUND_Sample_SetMode and removed A3D support.
- Gave PTR_BounceTraverse() knowledge of ML_BLOCKEVERYTHING lines.
- Moved the check for MF2_BOUNCETYPE to the beginning of P_BounceWall().
- Added support for custom inventory classes. These are actors that behave
  like an inventory item and execute their special when touched, but they
  don't actually go in the inventory.
- Added a new field to DObject to record the object's real type. Now derived
  types created at runtime can be detected. I am now one step closer to having
  the scripting language in place. :-)

August 20, 2002
- Added support for custom decorative classes through the use of a
  DECORATE lump. Currently, all objects generated like this are
  recognized as being type Decoration instead of their real type.
  This isn't really a problem, but I would like to figure out a way
  to easily support objects that are identified as being of a
  run-time-created type.

August 19, 2002
- Fixed: DumpHash would count all the aliases and commands, not just
  the ones it counted.

August 16, 2002
- Added some new initialization code that was missing for old Hexen
  behaviors.
- Fixed: World and global variables were not stored in save games.
- Changed sidedef indices to be unsigned, so now you can have up to
  65535 of them in a level.

August 14, 2002
- Added support for 8 mouse buttons using DirectInput and at least 5
  mouse buttons using standard Windows messages. I extrapolated from
  Microsoft's docs for WM_XBUTTONDOWN/UP, so it will probably work with
  up to 8 buttons if Microsoft ever releases a mouse with more buttons.

August 12, 2002
- Finished adding support for ACS libraries. Now I just need to test it
  some more.
- Fixed: ACS arrays were not serialized.

August 3, 2002
- Added compressed demo support.
- Fixed: PCD_ASSIGNMAPARRAY accessed ACS_WorldVars instead of level.vars,
  so storing to arrays was unpredictable unless you never touched any world
  vars. In that case, it would always store to the first array declared.

July 31, 2002
- Fixed some stuff with local doors already performing a ceiling action.
  In particular, if the ceiling was moving but not as a door, its thinker
  would be replaced with a door thinker instead of being left alone.
- Wallrunning seems to be gone. I don't know when it disappeared. I
  certainly set out trying to fix it.
- Fixed: The stairstep case for stepping along the x-axis in P_SlideMove()
  was the subject of some incomplete copy-and-paste, which is probably why
  it was so easy to get stuck on diagonal walls.

July 30, 2002
- Added a third parameter to the TranslucentLine special to select the
  translucency type. Currently it can be 0 for normal translucency or 1 for
  additive translucency. Also updated the translators to handle Legacy's
  284, 285, and 287 types.
- Made textures with patchless columns work.

July 29, 2002
- Finally did the math for the conversion of the SSG's vertical spread from
  slope to pitch and discovered that I had it slightly too small.
- Added COMPATF_SILENTPICKUP flag to play item pickup sounds locally only.
- Moved NO_PASSMOBJ flag from dmflags to compatflags.
- Moved sv_ihatesounds into compatflags as COMPATF_MAGICSILENCE.
- Removed SNDCURVE from zdoom.wad. Playing Doom will now generate a sound
  curve compatible with the Doom's original distance attenuation.

July 22, 2002
- Started work on an output class that using IDirect3D8 instead of
  IDirectDraw2, but then I found out IDirect3D8 can't do paletted output.
  I was hoping to get descent blitter support out of it, but if I have to
  translate the image every frame, it might not be worth it. I could try
  getting tricky with the hardware gamma ramp so that I need only copy
  pixels out to the back buffer without doing any format conversion, but I
  don't know if it's worth it.

July 17, 2002
- Fixed session notification mysteriously crashing the game with a release
  build. Because the default calling convention for the release build is
  set to __fastcall, I need to explicitly specify that the functions I
  retrieved using GetProcAddress are __stdcall. (But that doesn't explain
  why they worked with the debug build.)

July 11, 2002
- Fixed some bugs when I_MovieDisableSound() is called when there are
  repeating sounds playing.
- Added some support for XP's session locking and fast user switching. Now
  you can use either, and the window will be able to properly restore itself,
  and it shuts down the sound when the session is locked. For some reason,
  I cannot get MIDIs to play in my other account. I would blame stupid
  Audigy bugs, but it doesn't work with Microsoft's GS synth either.

July 9, 2002
- Changed the behavior of MF_SPECIAL actors so that non-inventory actors
  will execute their specials when touched.

July 2, 2002
- Changed sector_t::FindShortestTextureAround and ::FindShortestUpperAround
  to not consider texture 0 for height determinations, so now they can return
  lengths greater than 64 if any lines around the sector have an untextured
  side. The compat_shortTex cvar can be used to get the original Doom
  behavior back. These functions now know about scaled textures and always
  return the result in world units.

June 25, 2002
- Made the C versions of the plane drawers work with non-64x64 flats.
- Added automatic scaling of 128x128 and 256x256 flats so that they get
  treated as if they were only 64x64 world units in size. Also added support
  for 8x8, 16x16, and 32x32 flats, which are not automatically scaled larger
  to fit a 64x64 cell.

June 19, 2002
- Added support for 128x128 and 256x256 flats on slopes.

June 14, 2002
- Added support for 128x128 and 256x256 flats on normal planes.

June 13, 2002
- Fixed: When a player spawned, the local player's view would be reset to
  whoever they spied through last.
- Fixed positioning of scaled pegged upper textures. I was not compensating
  for the texture's scale.
- Fixed: Demo sequence would loop to DEMO2 instead of DEMO1.
- Fixed handling of PNG tEXt chunks. I misread the specs, thinking that the
  keyword always occupied 80 bytes, but that's just the maximum size for the
  keyword. It can be smaller and does not get padded with zeros.

June 12, 2002
- Fixed: When missiles destroyed themselves right away in their death state,
  the game would crash if it tried to move them again (because their movement
  was divided into multiple steps).

June 11, 2002
- Fixed: BestColor_MMX set ebx before saving it, and it did it after ecx
  had already been shifted. I don't know why it worked at all.
- Changed the project settings to statically link to the CRT under VC7
  because I don't want to redistribute MSVCR70.dll.
- Experimented with separating the various games into libraries but stopped
  when I found out that I had no easy way to bring all the actor definitions
  into the executable that I wanted.
- Removed lots of warnings when VC7 is set to look for 64-bit portability
  complications.
- Added MF_COUNTKILL to ALostSoul and changed the monster counting to
  happen in AActor::StaticSpawn instead of at map load time.
- Fixed stylization of console backgrounds that are derived from title pics
  that are not 320x200.
- Added named thread support to the FHelperThread class.
- Moved zdoom.ini to the CSIDL_APPDATA directory so different users can have
  different zdoom.ini files.
- Added -cdrom support under Linux courtesy of Hirogen2.
- Added the work-around to allow FBaseCVar::ToInt() to compile with GCC 2.95.
- Added XP visual styles support for the dialogs.
- Added more OS names to I_DetectOS().
- Removed PROP_STATE_BASE because I could not get it to compile with VC7.
  All state sharing must now be done using inheritance.
- Changed the ALavaSomke definition to set the default alpha using an
  AT_GAME_SET function. Aside from causing VC7 to gobble up all available
  memory and crash horribly, using the PROP_Alpha macro in this situation is
  incorrect because it depends on information that is not available at compile
  time.

May 6, 2002
- Fixed spawn(spot) so that they only set MF_DROPPED for items and not
  everything.
- Changed R_DrawColumnInCache() so that it correctly draws patches with
  a negative originy.
- Added Thing_Hate special.
- Added a name string ("Unnamed") to the default level info so that using
  changemap to switch between maps without an associated level info does
  not crash (although it does prevent saving on those levels).
- Fixed the stringlist utility to sort string names case-insensitively
  because the game uses a case-insensitive search to find them.
- Initialized air_finished in P_SpawnPlayer so that if you spawn underwater
  after drowning in a multiplayer game, you won't start drowning immediately.
- Fixed: AArtiEgg and AGibs did not have spawn states so they could not be
  placed on a map.
- Fixed: Say(_team) did not check that they were called with any parameters.

April 27, 2002
- Added more error checks when loading the BSP tree.

April 18, 2002
- Removed the bot things list because it couldn't handle items that had been
  removed from the level.
- Changed movie playback to only exit when escape is pressed. Also disabled
  Alt-Tabbing away from fullscreen movies so that I don't have to worry
  about the messed-up state that can put things in.
- Fixed: When a movie was not found, I_PlayMovie could try to restore video
  resources it never released because runningFull was not initialized right
  away.
- Added a new Thing_ProjectileAimed special (178).
- Added MF2_SEEKERMISSILE to the RevenantTracer.
- Added slopes and aligned flats to the BUILD loader.
- Changed P_GivePower() to not check if the player already has the power
  when playing Doom.
- Added pattern matching for the -file parameter.

April 17, 2002
- Added a loader for BUILD maps. It's not very useful since the Doom engine is
  so much more limited than BUILD, but it's fun to be able to load them anyway.
- Added a NoAlert flag for splashes that you don't want monsters to hear.
- Removed the option of specifying multiple footstep sounds for terrain
  because the $random SNDINFO command can do the job better. (And no, footsteps
  are still not implemented.)
- Made splash sounds work even without a corresponding splash actor.
- Removed the MF3_VERYFAST flag. Any missiles with a speed of 100 or more will
  automatically be offset closer to the originator than a normal missile.

April 16, 2002
- Changed P_XYMovement() to take smaller steps when moving faster than is good
  for the actor's size.

April 15, 2002
- Changed floor bounces so that they properly reflect off of slopes.
- Added the CVAR_NOSAVE flag so that I can use it with sv_gravity and
  sv_aircontrol to avoid archiving them with a savegame. If I do save them,
  then reading them back will override the real settings for those variables
  that are stored in the level structure.
- Added the Thing_Damage special (119). It's similar to DamageThing, except it
  hurts things by TID instead of whoever activated it.
- Removed the LEVEL_NOSOUNDCLIPPING flag. When sounds are at maximum distance,
  they are very quiet and hard to hear so it didn't seem worthwhile to keep
  the code around for this.

April 9, 2002
- Fixed: Particles were not drawn in the color of their containing sectors
  when using light amp goggles.
- Added code to make the pain elemental move down if it's too close to the
  ceiling to successfully launch a lost soul.

April 6, 2002
- Fixed: P_TestMobjLocation() should test the central z of an actor with
  float bob, not its current z.
- Fixed: Only the colormap stored in the wad was created with new. The rest
  were still on the zone heap. There's also no reason why they need to be
  aligned to 256 byte boundaries.

April 5, 2002
- Added SPC music support using snesapu.dll.

April 4, 2002
- Changed text scaling at 800x600 and similar resolutions to keep everything
  square.
- Added two rotozoomers on top of the plasma to make it look more interesting.
- Fixed: Colors set with setcolor now carry over to new maps.
- Removed the sv_friction cvar because it was never used.
- Added a few substitutions for chat messages. Set chat_substitution to true,
  and $health, $weapon, $armor, $ammo, and $ammocount will be replaced by
  appropriate strings.
- Added /me support for chat messages.
- Changed the setweapon ACS command to disallow switching to a weapon the
  player does not have enough ammo for.
- Changed S_ChangeMusic() so that an empty string will also stop the currently
  playing music.
- Changed the announcements for player team and name to be shown only if the
  new values are different from the old ones.

April 2, 2002
- Added another bounce flag so that the bounce type can be selected by actor
  instead of by game.
- Fixed the [*.Autoload] ini sections so that they work with wildcards for
  files that are not in the current directory.
- Replaced the fire in the player setup menu with a plasma.
- Moved thinkers off of the zone heap.

April 1, 2002
- Changed R_FreeTags to move the rover back to the beginning of the zone.
- Moved sprite frames off of the zone heap because they constituted a lot
  of small locked blocks. Did the same for texture column directories,
  colormaps, switches, terrain types, skins, sound sequences, msecnodes,
  and SNDCURVE. The only things left on the heap now that are unpurgable
  are the level data.
- Added a calling history to the zone heap when compiled with _DEBUG so I
  can see where all the zone memory is going.
- Changed Z_Malloc so that it only throws away purgable blocks if doing so
  will result in a block large enough for the requested allocation.

March 28, 2002
- Added an extra max parameter to HealThing. 0 will uses the creature's
  spawn health as max. 1 will use the max soulsphere health as max. Anything
  above that will be used as an absolute maximum.

March 25, 2002
- Made sky textures that are scaled vertically draw properly.
- Made the sky textures scalable horizontally.
- Verified that the PNG loader really can handle the different filters.
- Made the weapon slots configurable.
- Commented out the code that prevents people from using dehacked with
  Heretic and Hexen.
- Changed the decision of whether or not to spawn puffs when a line attack
  strikes an actor into an actor property.
- Added code to set PuffType for all the bullet attacks in Doom.
- Changed P_CheckMissileSpawn to not decrement the missile's first tics if
  the tics are less than one. Now the Centaur Leader can shoot his missile
  when spawned in Doom.
- Added the projectiles Hexen only spawns from scripts.
- Fixed: $pitchshift could not be used before defining a sound, so none
  of the Hexen sounds that don't want to be shifted stayed unshifted.
- Fixed: ZXmasTree, ZBell, and ZSuitOfArmor had undefined mass.
- Fixed: ZPoisonShroom had undefined health and mass, and it didn't spawn
  a poison cloud on death.
- Fixed: The Heretic snake did not have an attack sound.

March 23, 2002
- Fixed: PCD_SETTHINGSPECIAL fell through to PCD_THINGSOUND.

March 22, 2002
- Fixed: When the minotaur stops charging, he now properly turns off his
  invulnerability.
- Fixed: The dehsupp utility was case-sensitive when adding names but not
  when using them, so bex patches could not specify the NOGRAVITY flag by name
  because it has the same name as the NoGravity function, and both versions
  of the name were stored in the dehsupp lump.
- Using a dehacked patch to set the initial bullets to 0 will now cause the
  player to start with their fist raised instead of the pistol.
- Changed the error message for switches with invalid second texture names
  to a warning.
- Fixed: The fighter boss's extreme death crashed the game because it used
  A_SkullPop, which assumed that the actor's player member was non-NULL.
- Gave the bots some knowledge of Heretic weapons so they don't slow things
  down so bad in that game.

March 21, 2002
- Added a teamplay scoreboard.
- Added: Bots now join a random team if they aren't specifically assigned a
  team in bots.cfg.
- Added: When teamplay is true, players (finally) use their team colors.
- Added a sector action that gets triggered when an actor hits the sector's
  fake floor. (doomednum 9989)
- Added another flash state to the pistol so that if people want to use a
  patch to make it behave like a railgun or plasma rifle (and keep the flash
  states), it will work without crashing.
- Fixed: A_FireCGun() assumed that flash states were present. This is not
  normally a problem, but dehacked patches can make this precondition false.
- Fixed: Ambient sounds saved their NextCheck time in gametics, so you
  wouldn't be able to hear them after a load until the game had been running
  at least as long as it had been running when you saved.
- Added support for encrypting ACS strings, and added the ACS_ExecuteWait
  shortcut to ACC. ACS_ExecuteWait(x, ...) is equivalent to ACS_Execute(x,...);
  ScriptWait(x); It uses the existing p-codes instead of introducing more of
  its own. Think of it as syntactic sugar.

March 20, 2002
- Added code to the node builder to group segs by their line equations so that
  when there are several segs that would create the same partition line, only
  one of them needs to be checked to see if it is a good splitter.

March 19, 2002
- Changed polyobj container detection in the node builder to work the same
  way it does in the game: A polyobject's subsector is determined by its
  center after it gets translated to its start spot--not by the start spot
  itself. One case where this distinction is important is the polyobject north
  of the dining room in Hexen MAP33; its start spot is in a sector different
  from where it appears.

March 18, 2002
- Fixed: When I inlined the point-on-line-side functions, I messed up and
  counted being right on the line as being behind it, when it should count
  as being in front of the line.
- Changed polyobject container detection to just mark the segs that form
  a loop around the polyobject spawn spot instead of all the segs in the
  sector. This helps keep the BSP from getting too deep around containers
  in nonconvex sectors and is also necessary for Hexen, MAP39 to build
  correctly.
- Improved the polyobject container splitting avoidance so that splitters
  colinear with the segs of the container are valid.

March 16, 2002
- Added code to the node builder to detect sectors polyobjects appear
  within and try hard to avoid using splitters that touch their segs.
- Improved the node builder so that it can split up convex areas with
  segs from different sectors so that each subsector only references
  one sector.
- Added support for loading maps without nodes or a reject matrix.
- Tweaked the heuristic used by the node builder to give more weight to
  splitters that split few lines.

March 15, 2002
- Fixed the console ticker so the node builder can use it.
- Changed subsector_t's firstline and numlines members to be unsigned,
  doubling the maximum number of segs a map can have. The built-in node
  builder doesn't try very hard to minimize splits.
- Added an internal node builder so that if any 0-length lines are removed,
  the nodes will still be valid. This may or may not actually be necessary
  depending on the node builder originally used; it's just to be safe. I
  make no attempt to fix convex areas belonging to more than one sector, so
  it's still a good idea to fix the map and use a better node builder. At
  least this one seems pretty fast: I can rebuild Vrack2's nodes in just a
  few seconds using a debug build.

March 14, 2002
- Lines of 0 length are now removed entirely from the map. Massmouth had
  invalid front sector references only on its 0-length lines, so removing
  them conveniantly lets it run again despite the beefed-up error checking.
- Removed the angle member from seg_t because it isn't really needed.
- Undid Killough's relayout of R_PointToAngle2 so that I can actually read it
  and do some optimization. Its compiled size is now 256 bytes less than
  before.

March 11, 2002
- Added the mage's first weapon.
- Changed A_SpawnFly to play "brain/spawn" instead of "misc/teleport".
  Changed the spawn cube explosion sound to "brain/cubeboom".
- Changed $ambient point attenuation parsing to use IsFloat() to check if
  the attenuation is present.
- Changed SNDINFO parsing so that non-male players can use random sounds.
- Did some space tuning to R_RenderBoundWallSprite() and R_DrawVisSprite().
- Fixed R_ProjectSprite() to calculate the correct left and right edges for
  horizontally scaled sprites.
- Changed the sound limit for Heretic's horn rod.
- Added LEVEL_SPECKILLMONSTERS to the definitions for Heretic's ExM8, where
  x >= 2, so killing the boss monsters will kill the rest of the levels'
  monsters, as it should.
- Fixed: The minotaur would stay invulnerable if his charge was interrupted
  before his one-second charge time was up (i.e. he hit something or went into
  his pain state).

March 10, 2002
- Fixed: If you visited Doom E2M9, saved, and then reloaded after quitting and
  restarting, the game would crash at the intermission because it would try
  to draw the Fortress of Mystery without loading its graphic first. This
  would also happen if you started with -warp 2 9.

March 9, 2002
- Added the cleric's first three weapons and the mage's second and third
  weapons.

March 8, 2002
- Added the fighter's axe and hammer.
- Added Hexen's cleric and mage bosses and Korax.
- Fixed: PTR_AimTraverse crashed when non-players aimed at ghosts.

March 7, 2002
- Added Hexen's puzzle items, boots of speed, krater of might, and fighter
  boss.

March 6, 2002
- Added Hexen's armor, bat spawner, and teleport other and dark servant
  artifacts.

March 5, 2002
- Added Hexen's wraiths, fog patches, flames, disc of repulsion, and dragon.
- Changed EttinMace, CentaurShield, and CentaurSword to use a crash state
  instead of A_CheckFloor. Now I can get rid of A_CheckFloor.

March 4, 2002
- Fixed: SendWeaponSlot and SendWeaponChoice need to be initialized to 255 at
  compile time. If they're left at 0, then weapon switch commands will be
  generated for the very first tic run if the level has not been loaded yet.
  This happens when playing demos from the command line, because they tic
  before loading anything (including themselves).
- Changed the health bonus's spawn id to 152 so that it isn't the same as the
  scripted marine's.
- Fixed: GetWordSpace in d_dehacked.cpp only allocated half as much memory
  as was needed. (But since x86 processors are fine with unaligned accesses,
  I don't really need to allocate memory. Ah well.)

March 2, 2002
- Fixed TossChunks() to toss the demons' chunks out in the correct directions.
- Finished migrating the code to the new RNG system. In the process, I
  discovered that constructors for static objects local to a function will
  not be called until the first time the function containing it is called.
  So all FRandom objects need to have global scope or else loading a savegame
  won't find any RNGs that haven't been used yet.

February 28, 2002
- Changed the random number generator system to use objects to represent
  different generators instead of array indices. Why? Because it makes
  adding new RNGs quicker--I just create a new FRandom object, and nothing
  else that uses random numbers needs to be recompiled.

February 27, 2002
- Changed the PNG reader and writer to use zlib streams directly without
  wrapper functions in order to use less memory. As part of this, I was
  able to test the case where a PNG has multiple IDATs to ensure that it
  gets read correctly, and ZDoom might now write a PNG with multiple IDATs.
- Fixed problems with the impact decal serializing: 1) The list of impact
  decals was messed up when loading a game. 2) Too many impact decals would
  cause a stack overflow because each impact decal would cause the next
  decal to write itself out before it finished writing itself, because it
  had to follow the list maintained in the tracer field.
- Extended the changemap command so that it can take an optional position
  number for maps that have multiple player starts.

February 26, 2002
- Fixed saving games without savepics. (Technically, because PNG is now used
  to store savegames, setting storesavepic to false will still leave an image
  in the savegame, because we need to create a valid PNG--but the image is
  only a 1x1 black grayscale pixel, so it adds just a few bytes to the file.
- Made savepics slightly taller to 162 pixels so that they look right when
  viewed with square pixels and no stretching.
- Fixed CRC calculations for extra PNG chunks so IE can be used to look at
  savegames, and there shouldn't be any problems loading them into image
  editors.
- Changed sprite serialization to save the sprite names instead of indices
  so that simply adding more sprites won't break savegames.

February 22, 2002
- Renamed snd_dolby cvar to snd_matrix.
- Made a few more general-purpose action functions accessible through BEX.
- Changed particles' right and bottom edges back to being inclusive instead
  of exclusive.
- Fixed: Shadowed masked blocks that were clipped drew the shadow on top of
  the regular image. The window when the clipping versions of the routine
  were used was also slightly smaller than needed.
- Fixed: Network games didn't work because the game forgot it was running a
  network game before it even loaded the map.
- Fixed the spawn and spawnspot ACS commands.

February 20, 2002
- Changed the savegame format to use PNG as a container. The use of chunks
  for different types of data helps reduce the need for introducing a new
  savegame version every time I change some little thing in what the
  savegames store, but the primary purpose for the switch is so that you
  can load the savegame into a paint program and see the savepic without
  having to do any extra work (except possibly changing the file extension
  to .png). It also gives launcher writers a public standard to use for
  loading the savegame pictures if they want to do so.
- Added the png_gamma cvar to control the gamma saved to PNG
  screenshots. Setting it to 0 will use the same gamma as the screen.

February 19, 2002
- Added support for writing PNG screenshots. PCX is still available as an
  option because it takes longer to create a PNG even at minimum compression.

February 18, 2002
- Changed LeftOffset and TopOffset in FTileSizes to signed words so that
  they can handle negative offsets (like they're supposed to).

February 16, 2002
- Changed actors' active sounds so that they only play if the actor is not
  already playing something on its voice channel.
- Removed the MF3_SEEISALSOACTIVE flag. Random sounds do the job better.
- P_SpawnPlayer() now clears spreecount, multicount, and listkilltime.
- Fixed: Spying through a bots eyes and then removing the bot would crash.
- Added \movebob\.25 as a default for bots.
- Fixed: P_SpawnPlayer() could not use the Hexen player 5-8 starts.
- Fixed: The view could still bob when you were dead if stillbob was non-0.
- Fixed an NT 4.0 waveout heap corruption bug that appeared with FMOD 3.5.
  I don't know if it's FMOD's fault, NT's fault, or the Audigy's drivers
  fault, but I have to initialize FMOD with FSOUND_OUTPUT_DSOUND before
  using FSOUND_OUTPUT_WINMM, or a heap used by the sound card's drivers
  will be corrupted when FSOUND_Close() is called.
- Updated the reverb code for FMOD 3.5.

February 14, 2002
- Added the friendly minotaur for Hexen.
- Added Hexen's flechette.
- Changed the Heresiarch's bishops so that they will automatically target
  whatever the Heresiarch is targetting.

February 13, 2002
- Added Hexen's keys.
- Changed P_BounceWall to take advantage of the BlockingLine global and use
  that as the line to bounce off of, if non-NULL.
- Added support for loading hexdd.wad as an IWAD, which really just means that
  hexen.wad is automatically loaded before it.

February 12, 2002
- Added Hexen's Heresiarch (Sorcerer).
- Fixed: Decals on an upper side used the lower texture to determine if decals
  are allowed and vice versa.

February 11, 2002
- The player_t struct now serializes the camera. Before, it always set it to
  mo when loading. I'm not sure why I did that, because it meant you lost your
  camera view when loading a game saved from a different camera.
- Fixed: SetWeapon only worked if passed the name of a Doom weapon. Anything
  else would make it crash.
- Changed HealThing so that it can max out at 200 for players.
- Added error checks for loading maps that don't have their BSP built.
- Added back "Health" as an item for checkinventory and "Armor" for
  checkinventory, takeinventory, and giveinventory.
- Fixed: The status bar face background was not translated to the player's
  current color. If you were playing a botmatch, the colored background would
  also not appear until you changed your color or respawned.
- Fixed: Loading a game before starting one would reset the skill to 0.
- Removed mouse grabbing from the Win32 I_InitInput. That happens later
  when the in_input cvar's callback is executed. This solves the problem of
  the mouse still being grabbed when startup fails.
- Changed startup handling so that if the game gets into its loop in the
  GS_STARTUP state, it will switch to GS_FULLCONSOLE so that the console will
  be useable. This can happen, for instance, if you specify an invalid file
  for -loadgame.
- Changed -loadgame to automatically append .zds to the specified file if it
  isn't already present.
- Fixed: DamageThing(0) did nothing instead of killing the activator.
- Fixed a potential crash when an alias causes itself to be removed as part of
  its execution.
- Fixed: Thanks to some left-over code when I changed the realiasing of
  existing aliases, the alias would be realiased, deleted, and then recreated.
  It should have just been realiased and not deleted.
- Fixed: Respawning after getting your head blown off (in Heretic or Hexen)
  would crash multiplayer games and could occasionally crash single player
  games as well. Those games set special2 to 666 when the player pressed
  space to respawn, and the severed head used this as a signal to remove
  itself. Because ZDoom cleans up stale pointers, this would leave the player
  without a valid camera for at least one frame before the player actually
  respawned, and the game would crash when it tried to draw the view. Now the
  severed heads wait until their player field becomes NULL before they destroy
  themselves.
- Fixed: BloodySkull and IceChunkHead would appear using the player's sprites
  because they were attached to players and inherited the skin. The fix is to
  add a dummy first state with a different sprite so that SetState will use
  the correct sprite.
- Added snd_fpumixer cvar.

February 8, 2002
- Added a new line to the miscellaneous dehacked section: "Monsters Ignore
  Each Other" will cause monsters never to target other monsters.

February 7, 2002
- Fixed: deh.MaxHealth was unused.
- Fixed: Operator<< for podoortype_t was call-by-value instead of call-by-
  reference, so polyobject doors could not be loaded properly.
- Changed sound code again so that unpositioned sounds do not call
  S_StopSoundID.
- Added A_SetFloorClip and A_UnSetFloorClip action functions for use by the
  cacodemon when it dies/resurrects.
- Added MF2_FLOORCLIP to the HellKnight.
- Moved the P_RunEffects() call so that it can be frozen in freeze mode.
- Added some new SNDINFO commands. $limit controls how many copies of a sound
  S_StopSoundID will allow. $pitchshiftrange controls how much a sound's
  pitch can change when using pitched sounds. And $pitchshift allows control
  of pitch shifting for a single sound.

February 5, 2002
- Did away with the longest-playing change to S_StopSoundID because it made
  looping sounds of the same type near each other fight for precedence, and
  the result sounded horrible. Now I use distance to limit the set of sounds
  considered for stopping. Only sounds within 256 units of the new sound will
  possibly be stopped by this function. Also removed sound tags because they
  served the same purpose as the distance comparison.
- Added $playercompat SNDINFO command to create special aliases from the old
  SNDINFO player sounds to the new ones. These are special in that after they
  get created, any attempts to modify them will modify there target instead.
- Added the addrocketexplosion cvar. If true, then rockets use additive
  translucency when the explode. Otherwise, they use normal translucency. This
  can still be overridden with a Dehacked patch.

February 4, 2002
- Realized that because I now project particles as their subsectors are
  entered, I have enough information to clip the particles when they are
  projected. By changing my code to take advantage of this, I can avoid
  running through all the drawsegs for each particle on-screen. When there are
  many drawsegs and particles on-screen at once, the improvement is quite
  impressive--far better than I expected.

February 2, 2002
- Added MF2_FLOORCLIP to many of the Doom monsters so that they can have their
  feet cut off when standing in shallow water, provided that the appropriate
  terrain definitions exist.
- Put back the limit of two identical sounds playing at once from Heretic and
  Hexen in order to prevent the SSG from making super loud splashes that drown
  out everything else. Tweaked S_StopSoundID so that it will use oldest time
  for selecting a sound to stop if it can't find any with lower priority.
- Set all the puffs except BeakPuff back to their default masses.
- Changed splashes so that if a fake flat has a terrain with a splash, you can
  shoot or drop below it and leave a splash.
- Fixed anomalies with the way the railgun made splashes.
- Added code to group particles into subsectors so that I can subject them to
  the same fake floor clipping as normal sprites. I also found a problem with
  lighting of particles in fake sectors and fixed it.

January 31, 2002
- Fixed: Fog boundaries could be erroneously drawn in underwater areas because
  R_FakeFlat did not change the fake sector's colormap when calculating the
  back side of a line.
- Fixed: Using -skill at the command line always set skill to 0.
- Added a check for freeze mode around P_ThinkParticles and the various
  decal animator tickers.
- Fixed .cfg file parsing so that if comments appear on the same line as a
  command, the command will still be executed.
- Fixed ParseCommandLine to work with unterminated quotes.
- Added "proper" support for tall textures by introducing a different patch
  format that uses words instead of bytes to store column lengths and offsets.
  All tall and multipatch textures get converted to this format at runtime, so
  tall textures work equally well on one-sided and two-sided lines, and I
  don't have to worry about sliding windows while generating the composite
  textures.

January 30, 2002
- Fixed: Addkeysection did not load bindings from the ini.
- Fixed: Quicksave did not quicksave.
- Fixed: Savegames could be listed in the menu twice, once with the full path
  and again with just the file name.
- Fixed: Suiciding and giving stuff to a player without an actor crashed.
- Fixed: Loading savegames was broken.

January 28, 2002
- Fixed: Using allowdecals in ANIMDEFS was broken.
- Added more ways to create slopes, all of which are thing-based:

	Things 9500 and 9501: The first argument to these things is a line id.
		For each matching line, the sector on the same side of the line
		has its floor or ceiling sloped so that it passes through this thing.
		The thing does not necessarily need to be in the sector(s) being
		sloped. 9500 slopes the floor, and 9501 slopes the ceiling.
	Things 9502 and 9503: Set the plane equation for the sector they are in
		directly. The first argument determines how far it tilts from
		horizontal and is measured in degrees. 90 degrees is perfectly
		horizontal. Values close to 90 have less slope than values further
		from 90. The thing's angle is used to determine what direction the
		slope faces. The floor or ceiling will be adjusted so that it passes
		through this thing. 9502 slopes the floor, and 9503 slopes the
		ceiling.
	Things 9510 and 9511: The first argument to these is a sector tag. The
		plane equation from the first sector with a matching tag will be
		copied to the sector that this thing is in. 9510 copies the floor
		plane, and 9511 copies the ceiling plane.

	Things 9500-9503 are processed after slopes created with linedef specials,
	so they can be used to further adjust the resultant slope. Things 9510
	and 9511 are processed after all other slopes are set up, so they override
	any slopes that might have been created in their sectors already.
	
January 26, 2002
- Assigned spawn numbers to most of the Heretic actors and added one for
  Doom's health bonus.
- Added ChangeSkill special (#179).
- Changed A_FireRailgun to use the ammouse field to determine how much ammo
  to eat up.
- Added a minammo member to FWeaponInfo and made it dehacked-settable.
- Fixed: Savegames went in the current directory instead of the program
  directory.
- Fixed: Aliases could not realias themselves reliably.
- Fixed: Particle drawing was erratic in sectors with fake floors.
- Improved detection of windows into below-deep-floor areas to have fewer
  false positives with complex geometry. It works for all the test cases I
  have now, so hopefully all the false positives have been eliminated.

January 25, 2002
- Because I can't figure out what's going wrong with the blitter, when loading
  an ini from a previous ZDoom version, vid_noblitter will now be reset to
  true, because I'm not sure it's benefiting anyone.
- Removed DFrameBuffer::PartialUpdate.
- Added more debugging spew and tried different blit techniques, and blits
  still take too long. They're supposed to be asynchronous, but my timings
  indicate otherwise--the blit times are proportional to the size of the
  blit, BltFast almost never returned DDBLT_WASSTILLDRAWING when I removed the
  _WAIT flag, and a 1600x1200 blit takes ~15 ms to complete (memcpy only needs
  ~4 ms to do the same thing). It seems like it's not using DMA at all but
  some lame software emulation instead, so I tried obtaining an
  IDirectDrawSurface2 interface and PageLocking the blitter surface, but it
  made no difference. Why did it work before but it doesn't now?
- Removed the unlock/lock around D_NetUpdate when rendering. This is only
  needed when a video memory surface is locked under Win9x. Since my
  experiment with writing directly to video memory is gone, this never
  happens.
- Fixed: Alt-tabbing away and back when using the blitter would fail to
  restore the lost surfaces, because system memory surfaces don't normally
  get lost from such a situation, so the LockSurf call would return ok, and
  the BltFast in Update would fail later.

January 24, 2002
- Added heapsize cvar so you don't need to use -heapsize if you always want
  to use a heap other than 8 megabytes. Moved Z_Init to happen after loading
  the config file so that the cvar is available when it gets called.
- Lines with sky on the front and back are no longer considered fog
  boundaries. As long as fog does not effect the sky, it looks bad to be
  drawing the boundaries of different fogs in outdoor areas.
- Fixed: R_ProjectParticle() did not set vis->cx, so R_DrawSprite() was
  unable to properly determine if a drawseg was in front of a particle or
  not.
- Added a #wadauthor switch to ACC to cause it to create dummy scripts for
  all the real scripts in the map so WadAuthor's error checking will know
  about them. I had to change my ACSe detection to no longer look for scripts
  that appear to have 0 scripts and strings. Since the standard ACC will
  never generate object files with the ACSe tag, this should be safe.
- I think I must have messed up the blitter code somewhere, because now it
  slows down the machine it used to speed up. I don't see anything wrong
  though! Changed the default for vid_noblitter to true until I can figure
  out what's going on.
- Added vid_vsync cvar to control whether or not vsync is used when flipping
  the display. Since the framerate gets clamped well below the refresh rate,
  turning off vsync is probably useless.

January 23, 2002
- Fixed: Deleting the most recently saved game and then dying would crash
  because the game would try to load that game and fail because it no longer
  exists.
- Added disableautosave cvar to control when autosaves happen. At 0, autosaves
  always happen. At 1, they only happen when an autosave special is activated.
  At 2, they never happen. Also disabled autosaving when starting a new game.
  Autosaves now happen only when advancing to a new map.
- Fixed: Exiting a level in Heretic crashed.
- Fixed: FSOUND_OUTPUT_WINMM was always used if snd_output was not set to
  dsound. Also added "directsound" as a synonym for "dsound" when used with
  this cvar.

January 22, 2002
- Changed the in-game priority class to normal so ZDoom won't give itself
  a high priority when running.
- Added "Ammo use" field for dehacked weapon modifications.
- Fixed palette translation through Dehacked again. While I was at it, I
  decided to remove translation control from the actor's flags member
  entirely and just rely on the Translation member.
- Fixed: Bouncing a missile off a floor/ceiling near a wall could crash if
  no missiles had already bounced off a wall.
- Fixed: PIT_RadiusAttack() only pushed things in directions with positive
  x and y.
- Gave names to the anonymous structs in p_setup.cpp/sidei_t so that it
  compiles with GCC 2.95.3.
- Rearranged FBaseCVar::ToInt() to try and compile it with GCC 2.95.3.

January 20, 2002
- Fixed: Picking items up when item respawn is enabled would mess up collision
  detection because the items would move themselves back to their original
  positions, and the collision detection code is not reentrant. They now
  relocate themselves as the result of a state change later on.
- Made some changes to the renderer to support drawing textures with different
  scales on the same wall and to also support obtaining textures scaling from
  some of the previously unused bytes in the maptexture_t structs stored in
  the wad.

January 19, 2002
- Added support for DeePsea's tall patches.
- Fixed: Sky textures wider than 1024 could not scroll properly because the
  sky position was always clamped past 255.

January 17, 2002
- Added a new player property: PROP_INSTANTWEAPONSWITCH (2). When set, the
  player can switch weapons instantly without lowering and raising them.

January 16, 2002
- Fixed: Autoaim could mess up. Same reason as PTR_SightTraverse below.
- Changed giveinventory when giving a weapon so that the weapon will not be
  brought up automatically if the player did not have it already. If this is
  desired, it can be simulated with setweapon.
- Disabled drawing of the crosshair when the camera is not a player.
- Fixed a problem under NT4 when using waveout for sound effects and playing
  MIDI music: A memory block would be modified after being freed. The fix is
  a 50 ms delay between stopping the song and shutting down the sound.
- Added "waveout" as a synonym for "winmm" for the snd_output cvar.
- Added CheckWeapon and SetWeapon ACS commands.
- Added support for a -1 translation in Thing_SetTranslation to set the
  target's translation to that of the activator's.

January 14, 2002
- Fixed a bug in PTR_SightTraverse() that could cause it to think something
  was visible when it really wasn't.
- Fixed: Masked mid textures in foggy areas could be drawn with the wrong
  light level, because they checked the foggy flag to determine if they were
  in a foggy area. This flag is not set when drawing masked mid textures.
- Added a tx cvar to test different horizontal wall texture scales.
- Fixed some errors GCC found and added GetFlashedPalette() to SDLVideo
  so that ZDoom compiles under Linux again.

January 12, 2002
- Added a ty cvar to test different vertical wall texture scales.

January 10, 2002
- Added a vid_noblitter cvar to force memcpy to be used for copying from
  system to video memory, even when the blitter is available to do the job.
  On my P3-866 with a GeForce2 Go, the blitter is about twice as fast as
  memcpy. On my Athlon XP 1600+ with GeForce2 MX, memcpy is about three
  times faster than the blitter. I need more data before I can decide what
  a reasonable default for different systems is, but right now it defaults
  to false.
- Fixed: The blitter surfaces would only flip when logging was enabled
  because I had the Flip call enclosed inside a LOG1 macro.
- Fixed the case where the video driver reported it could blit from system
  to video memory, but the blitter surfaces could not be allocated. When this
  happened, the screen would not update.

January 9, 2002
- Changed P_CheckSlopeWalk() to return false if the actor's floorsector is
  different from the actor's sector. It seems to fix the problem with the
  "push pad". The whole Doom collision detection/movement code is a mess and
  deserves to be rewritten from the ground up.
- Changed sky texture positioning to match older versions. It should be based
  on the height of the screen, not the height of the texture.
- Commented out a check at the beginning of wallscan(), because sky boxes can
  make the check invalid.

January 8, 2002
- By default, animated textures will no longer have decals drawn on top of
  them. This can be changed by adding "allowdecals" to the animation sequence
  in ANIMDEFS.
- Moved the SpawnableThings/DoomEdMap initialization out of
  FActorInfo::StaticGameSet() into ::StaticSetActorNums() so that Dehacked
  patches that change doomednums will work as expected.

January 7, 2002
- Added an error message for switches that have more than one sound for their
  on or off states.
- Fixed: Creating a switch with a valid start texture but an invalid second
  texture would crash when you tried to use the switch. Now you get an error
  when the ANIMDEFS is parsed.

January 5, 2002
- Wrote some code for Convert24(). Since my video card does not support 24-bit
  displays, I had to test it using a 32-bit display instead, but it seems to
  be working.
- Removed the special case for writing to 8-bit windowed displays in
  win32video.cpp.
- Added turnspeeds command to adjust the keyboard turning rate.
- Added sin, cos, and vectorangle ACS functions. They use 16-bit angles. 0 is
  0 degrees, and 65536 would be 360 degrees if it didn't wrap to 0.

January 4, 2002
- Fixed: CheckIWAD() would consider as valid any files that were present in
  the search, even if they weren't IWADs. Hence, something like
  "zdoom -iwad zdoom.exe" would be accepted and cause a crash.

January 3, 2002
- Got rid of the divide in P_AdjustLine when it calculated the slopetype for
  diagonal lines. Because only the sign of the result is significant, a
  simple xor is enough. Did the same for UpdateSegBBox.
- Turned R_PointOnSide into a simple inlining of DivScale32. Multiplies are
  cheaper than mispredicted branches, so I took out the special cases for
  perfectly horizontal and vertical lines. Also made similar changes to
  P_PointOnLineSide and P_PointOnDivlineSide, which are exactly the same
  thing, except they use different line representations. Also inlined
  P_MakeDivline, because it's so simple.

January 2, 2002
- Moved cl_bobscale and cl_stillbob into userinfo (and renamed them to
  movebob and stillbob). There are sector actions that depend on the player's
  eye height, so these values need to be sent across the network.
- Optimized R_DrawFogBoundary() by drawing horizontal spans instead of
  vertical strips.

December 24, 2001
- Added a check for sectors without any lines in p_setup.cpp. If any are
  found, their tags are set to 0 so that they cannot be used by most specials.

December 22, 2001
- Fixed: If you saved over a savegame from a different ZDoom version, the menu
  would still list it as being from a different version until you quit and
  restarted the game.
- Added the CreateTranslation ACS command and Thing_SetTranslation special to
  allow changing the translation used by any actor.
- Added a ScriptedMarine actor. It looks just like the player but wears indigo
  and acts like a monster (except its attacks don't actually do anything).
  Doomednum 9100, spawnable #151.

December 21, 2001
- Added function and array support to ZDoom's ACS VM.

December 18, 2001
- Fixed: Player corpses would revert to the default skin if the player
  respawned before their death animation finished.
- Changed the Doom weapons so that they use the ammouse member of FWeaponInfo.
  This way, when a deh patch sets a weapon to no ammo, I can set its ammouse to
  0, and nothing will change when the weapon is fired..
- Changed video code so that if the blitter is not being used to copy the
  frame from system memory, all the drawing will still happen in system memory
  because the processor has faster access to it than video memory.
- Changed video code so that it works with drivers that do not support
  FLIP_NOVSYNC.

December 16, 2001
- Changed the SSG flash to not last longer than the associated weapon frame.

December 8, 2001
- Fixed: CheckIfExitIsGood() always returned false if self was NULL. This
  meant open scripts could not change the level.
- Fixed: Exit_Normal and Exit_Secret specials ignored their position
  arguments and always used position 0.

December 7, 2001
- Changed PIT_RadiusAttack() to be closer to the original behavior. Doom does
  radius damage in a square pattern, not a circle. Oops!

November 23, 2001
- Changed translationtables into an array of translation tables and fixed a
  bug with the serialization of decals with custom translations in the
  process.
- Added the CreateTranslation command to ACC.
- Redesigned the layout of ACSe/ACSE files so that they can be included with
  editors other than ZETH. The new format looks like a normal ACS\0 file with
  some junk in the string area but no actual scripts or strings. The old
  ACSe/ACSE format is still supported for people who took the time to compile
  the ACC 1.16 source I had posted.

November 22, 2001
- Changed the translation member of AActor to an index into the
  translationtables array.
- Added the Thing_SpawnFacing special. It works like Thing_Spawn(NoFog)
  except the angle of the new actor is taken from the spot where it spawns at.
- Corrected the xspeed and yspeed arrays in p_enemy.cpp so that they better
  reflect diagonal movement at the correct speed of 1.

November 20, 2001
- More tool work: Added IMGZ, FON1, and FON2 loading support and ILBM, PCX,
  and BMP writing support to imagetool. It loads FON1 and FON2 as images, not
  fonts, so converting to/from FON1 and FON2 requires extra work on the user's
  part. However, it does make it possible to obtain an editable image for
  the font that can be used to create another font of the same type. It also
  makes imagetool usable as a general-purpose image conversion program, which
  is fitting considering that it was spawned from an ILBM to PCX converter I
  had written earlier.

November 19, 2001
- Changed FFont to construct a font whose glyphs are all the same height so
  that I don't need to keep track of the height and y-offset of individual
  characters.
- Fixed the FONTA63 character in zdoom.wad to be a proper copy of the
  underscore character for Heretic/Hexen.
- Fixed: The Beak's weapon infos did not have their type member filled in.

November 15, 2001
- Changed fog boundary handling so that black fog is treated like diminishing
  light rather than fog, so it will not appear on a boundary.
- Fixed: The Fortress of Mystery appeared on the intermission map when
  entering E2M8 instead of E2M9. It will also stay on the map after you
  finish it now.
- Fixed: When using the changemap command to switch episodes in Doom 1, only
  the episode just finished would be shown during the intermission.
- Renamed CONCHARS to CONFONT.
- Merged all of the FONTB?? graphics in zdoom.wad into a single DBIGFONT
  lump, partly to save space but mostly because I wanted an example font to
  include with imagetool when I distribute it.
- After inspiration struck, I added some code to make fog boundaries look
  better: At a two-sided line where the front fog is different from the back
  fog, draw a solid-colored window of varying translucency in the color of
  the front fog color. This is effectively what creating a new colormap for
  each fog color already does for sprites and one-sided lines.

November 13, 2001
- Added FON2 creation support to imagetool. Like FON1, this is a font format,
  but this one supports characters of varying widths and a custom palette.

November 12, 2001
- Tool work: Added pcx, bmp, and patch loading support to imagetool.
- Fixed: Screen shots did not capture the palette blend.
- Added the ability for HUD messages to resize themselves when the screen
  size changes.
- Removed precachefonts command from ACC, as I decided it was not needed.

November 10, 2001
- Implemented the setfont command.
- Fixed: HUD messages were not saved with save games.
- Added decal teleporting support to TeleportInSector so that decals can move
  between the different shafts of a fake 3D elevator. Then I commented it out
  because doing it right is too hard.

November 9, 2001
- Added the ACS functions setfloortrigger, setceilingtrigger, getactorx,
  getactory, and getactorz. The first two are to make convincing fake 3D
  lifts possible. The last three are there because they have been requested
  a lot.

November 8, 2001
- Fixed: Elevators did not set floordata or ceilingdata, so you could not
  tagwait on them.
- Improved sprite clipping by fake flats further. Now you can look into an
  underwater area through a window, and the sprites in it will still show
  when your view is above water.

November 7, 2001
- Fixed: Autosaves do not become the default quicksave if the player has not
  saved a game manually yet.
- FMOD 3.33 also has some division by zero issues, so now I'm back to using
  FMOD 3.40--but this one was updated with some more checks that seem to be
  keeping the division errors away. Unfortunately, the updated FMOD 3.40
  isn't available for Linux yet.
- Fixed: G_InitNew() was calling StaticGameSet(), but that only needs to be
  called during startup. Calling it again later can cause some Dehacked
  changes to be undone.
- Fixed: Swimming into a one-sided line while in water would try to jump you
  out of the water. Since there's nothing on the other side of the line,
  that's rather pointless.
- Made R_DrawSkyBoxes() set the camera properly.
- Changed most instances of camera->Sector in the renderer with viewsector
  so that deep water clipping can behave as expected when using a chase
  camera that moves out of the same sector as the camera.
- Improved clipping of sprites by sloped fake floors. To be completely
  correct, the clip line should be sloped with the floor, but it's still
  horizontal because I am feeling lazy right now. At least things don't
  appear and disappear as you move around underneath a sloped fake floor.
- Added a sound to A_HeadAttack() so that the Cacodemon can be given a melee
  sound through SNDINFO.
- Changed A_CPosAttack() to use self->AttackSound instead of hard-coding it
  to "chainguy/attack". Now the WolfSS can have a different attack sound.
- Fixed: secplane_t::FlipVert() was wrong. It needs to negate everything, not
  just c and d. This prevented sloped fake floors and ceilings from
  displaying properly.

November 6, 2001
- Added things 9983 and 9982 to perform actions when going below and above
  fake ceilings.
- Added some more Transfer_Heights modifiers: 16 causes the control sector
  to have no effect at all on the target sector. With this modifier, it is
  used solely for triggering sector actions. 32 causes the control sector to
  not effect the lighting in the target sector.
- Added two new sector actions: SecActEyesDive (9993) and SecActEyesSurface
  (9992). When used in conjunction with TeleportGroup, these can produce the
  Duke3D silent teleport to and from underwater sectors effect.
- Changed TeleportGroup so that if group_tid is 0, it treats the activator
  as the group.

November 3, 2001
- Made some changes to P_ExplodeMissile() so that missiles exploding on a
  corner are more likely to leave behind decals.
- Added the cvars cl_bobscale and cl_stillbob to control the amount of view
  bob when moving and standing still, respectively.

November 2, 2001
- Improved the accuracy of EV_SilentLineTeleport(). The original function was
  written as if the actor was always exactly on the line, so it calculated a
  destination position directly on the line and fudged with it to get the
  player on the correct side. It's better to find the closest point on the
  source line and the corresponding point on the destination line and then
  offset off of the destination line so that the actor is in the same
  relative position as it is to the source line. This eliminates the need for
  fudging, and I can't get stuck in the wall when teleporting in a sample
  level anymore.
- Why does the Doom map format have to store sectors only implicitly? Because
  of this, people can create maps with oodles of unclosed sectors. I've
  already had to modify my P_Trace() function because of this. Now I found
  out that they can cause problems if I don't always divide front space in
  R_RenderBSPNode(): I made it conditional because I assumed it was
  unconditional because of precision problems with using polar coordinates to
  perform the transformations. When sectors are well formed (and most are),
  having the check causes no visible problems. But when sectors are badly
  formed, it is possible that sprites in the sectors will not be drawn because
  the sectors do not actually get visited, even though the space they occupy
  is drawn.
- Changed the Doom fullscreen HUD so that health and armor counts are drawn
  at a location based on the actual font height.
- Fixed: DCanvas::DrawShadowedMaskedBlock and ::ScaleShadowedMaskedBlock did
  not check to make sure the shadow was drawn inside the screen. Now they do,
  and if the shadow lies partially off the surface, the image and shadow get
  drawn in two passes instead of one.

October 31, 2001
- Fixed: The bloodbath announcer was not entirely silent in single player
  games.
- Fixed AImpactDecal::SpreadLeft() and SpreadRight() so that they can spread
  across adjacent loops without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
- Fixed: Corpses can fall to the bottom of deep water now.
- Fixed a bug in P_Trace() when the trace is on the floor or ceiling and it
  hits a two sided line that blocks it.
- New: Instant hit weapons can make splashes in liquids, even deep ones.
  The size of the splash is determined by the weapon's puff's mass, so I set
  several of the puff actors to have masses of 5 so their trails only leave
  small splashes instead of big ones.
- Renamed DThinker::RunThink() to Tick().

October 30, 2001
- Finally added a playmovie command to ACS.
- Fixed: FDecalLibrary::GetDecalByNum() would only find the decal if it was
  on the right-most branch of the tree.
- Changed the subsector pointer in AActor to a sector pointer. The only place
  where it wasn't used to get the actor's containing sector was an early-out
  in P_CheckSight(). Since the sight checking in ZDoom uses the blockmap
  instead of the BSP, I doubt it provided much benefit, especially since it
  was rarely taken.

October 29, 2001
- Put back some code that lets you see underwater areas through windows. It
  is not perfect and cannot be used at the same time that you can see the
  abovewater area of any deep sectors.
- Fixed: The back side of a mirror could clip sprites in front of it because
  the determination of which side of a line a sprite is on was being done in
  world space. The solution is to use camera space for the determination
  instead. Since I was already calculating all the necessary values, the
  solution mostly involved extending vissprite_t and drawseg_t to hold the
  extra information.
- Fixed: Sectors set to drop their ceilings after 30 seconds would not go
  back to their original height if they were blocked while closing.
- Added the con_ctrl_d cvar so that I can set it to "quit" and press Ctrl-D
  at an empty console prompt to quit the game.
- Added the exit command as a synonym for quit.
- Added the defaultbind command.

October 27, 2001
- Made a slight optimization for sprite drawing by moving the floorclip
  clipping out of R_DrawMaskedColumn and into R_DrawSprite.
- Fixed: Spawning objects in a swimmable water area would create a splash on
  the water surface.
- Fixed: Passing +map at startup just prints a warning to the console instead
  of quitting altogether if the map could not be found.
- Added new options to Transfer_Heights: By setting the second argument to 2,
  only the deep water effect will be created. By setting it to 4, the fake
  floor and/or ceiling will only show if it is "inside" the sector, but only
  if the real sector's and the control sector's corresponding planes are not
  sloped. This also effects the texturing in that the control sector's
  textures are used for both the top and bottom of the surface they correspond
  to, and the sector being faked keeps its textures for its normal range.
  Set the first argument to 8, and it will be made into water even without a
  WaterZone actor in the control sector. These can be added together to
  combine effects. So Transfer_Heights (tag, 12) should produce an effect
  similar to Doom Legacy's 280 linetype.
- Added the test and eval console commands. Test is like if/then/else, and
  eval evaluates an expression, possibly storing the result in a variable.
  This should take care of all the major functionality the console was
  missing before.

October 26, 2001
- Made the atexit cvar a command that registers different commands to
  execute when the game quits.
- Cfg files listed at the start of the command line now get executed as if
  they had appeared after +exec. (i.e. "zdoom foo.cfg" works just like
  "zdoom +exec foo.cfg")
- Added the pullin command so that .cfg scripts loaded at startup can cause
  one or more wads to be loaded. (They "pull in" the wads they need.)
- Changed the exec command so that it can execute more than one file.
- Added the addkeysection and addmenukey commands for people writing console
  scripts.

October 25, 2001
- Added ACS commands fadeto, faderange, and cancelfade to do some palette
  blending stuff under scripted control.
- Added BloodSplash, BloodSplashBase, SlimeSplash, and SlimeChunk classes
  for anyone who wants to use them in a TERRAIN lump.
- Added the atexit cvar. It gets executed like an alias when the game quits.
- Added archivecvar command to force user-defined cvars to save themselves
  in the config file.
- Added snd_waterreverb cvar to disable the use of underwater reverb.
- Added support for specials with variable argument counts to ACC so that
  specials which have had parameters added (such as Thing_Spawn) can still
  be used without the extra parameter.
- Added TeleportOther (76) and TeleportGroup (77) specials.
- Added autosave capabilities. Up to four autosaves are kept at a time,
  and they get created whenever a player enters a map. The level designer
  can also place them at strategic locations in the level using special
  15 or linetypes 348/349.

October 24, 2001
- Fixed: The level name shown on the automap included the hours of the
  current time if the map was in a hub.
- Added Line_Horizon to DOOMX/HERETICX as linetype 337.
- Added am_showitems cvar to show the item count on the automap.
- Added pattern matching support to D_AddConfigWads().
- Fixed: Variable substitution only worked for the last argument of a
  command line.
- Removed FCommandLine::AllButFirstArg(). It did not handle variable
  substitution, and since you can escape quotes inside strings, it's not
  really neccessary, either.
- Added a generator line for the Spider Mastermind to DECALDEF.
- Added some division-by-zero checks to the projection calculations in
  R_AddLine(), R_CheckBBox(), and R_RenderBoundWallSprite().

October 23, 2001
- Added Scale and Decal properties to Dehacked thing sections. Added Decal
  property to Dehacked weapon sections.
- Changed the scalars in DECALDEF to be 1-based instead of 64-based. This
  lets me silently expand its range in the future without breaking existing
  decal definitions.
- Fixed: fixedlightlev was being applied to skies. It looks weird to see a
  torch lighting up the entire sky, so skies should ignore the setting of
  fixedlightlev.
- Fixed the scaled status bar. I was simply forgetting to add the image
  offsets in DBaseStatusBar::DrawImage() before calling CopyToScreen().
- Added code to let decals move with sliding and rotating polyobjects.
- Fixed: The wait console command waited one tic too few.
- Fixed a resizing problem with playing movies windowed.
- I think checkinventory, giveinventory, and takeinventory are fully working
  now.
- Made checkinventory not crash in open scripts.
- Made AInventory::TryPickup() public so that I can use it with
  giveinventory and avoid printing a message about the pickup.
- Passing an amount of 0 to takeinventory now removes all of that item
  from the player's inventory.
- Made TakeInventory work in open scripts.
- Removed the Health option from GiveInventory.
- Changed DamageThing so that negative damages cause it to act like
  HealThing.
- Added OldStyleID() methods to AFist, APistol, AStaff, and AGoldWand.

October 22, 2001
- Made clearinventory work in open scripts.
- Made ambientsound use CHAN_AUTO instead of CHAN_BODY, so you can have
  multiple overlapping ambientsounds.
- Fixed: Setplayerproperty was using the set property as the who property.
- Fixed: Closing the console when the overlay automap is active and the view
  window does not cover the width of the screen would not redraw the border.
- Fixed: The overlay automap did not center itself inside the view window.
- Fixed: When neverswitchonpickup was changed during a game, it would always
  become false in the playerinfo struct.
- Made the rocket explosion style modifiable through dehacked in the misc
  section. Use the keys "Rocket Explosion Style" and "Rocket Explosion Alpha"
  to change it.
- Changed the sky drawer so that it properly tiles skies of any height and
  not just those that are a power of 2.
- Changed R_InitSkyMap() so that tall skies will always be aligned at the
  top of the screen when looking all the way up. Now 240-tall skies will
  actually be useful, since so many people seem to think skies need to be
  that tall to be considered "tall" even though anything taller than 128
  pixels is "tall".
- Fixed: Files specified at the start of the command line were treated as
  if they were listed after a -bot parameter.
- Modified DArgs::GatherFiles() so that it can handle files listed after
  multiple instances of the same parameter (e.g. "-file 1.wad -file 2.wad")
- Changed ConsiderPatches() so that it tries appending both .deh and .bex to
  files listed after both -deh and -bex parameters, which means the two
  parameters now behave identically and are just synonyms for each other.
- Made a fix to BaseFileSearch() when it retries with an extension.

October 20, 2001
- Added range checks to R_SetVisibility to prevent visual glitches caused by
  too high visibility/fov combinations.
- Made r_visibility unchangeable in netgames.
- Made FOV changes get sent through the net interface, so they can be
  recorded in demos, and also so that they can be restricted with the new
  sv_nofov cvar.
- Fixed: Bool cvars (such as sv_nomonsters) would change their associated
  serverinfo var without going through the network.
- Fixed: The Doom status bar would not update the arms/frags area when the
  deathmatch cvar is changed during the game.
- Fixed: Player corpses could still make the grunt sound when they hit the
  ground.
- Fixed: StreamSong would always play at full volume until snd_musicvolume
  changed because it kept its own internal copy of the volume that was not
  updated with the actual volume until the cvar was changed.
- Made crushing ceilings call PlayCeilingSound() again, but only if the
  ceiling is not playing a looping sound. This fixes the almost silent crusher
  in Doom2 MAP04 that had become totally silent.
- Fixed: The weapon sprite did not flash when invisibility was about to run
  out.
- Made DECALDEF generators support using "None" to remove decals from actors.
- Added fullbright flag to the BFG lightning and plasma scorch decals.
- Fixed: Ambient things could not be spawned silent, because they start
  themselves with PostBeginPlay, which gets called after Deactivate
  when their dormant bit is set. So they would stop themselves and then
  immediately start again. Using BeginPlay fixes this, since it gets
  called before the dormant Deactivate.
- Fixed: S_RelinkSound() should not be able to move repeating sounds to
  positioned sounds. This fixes removing continuous ambient sound things
  from not stopping the sound immediately.
- Fixed: Deactivating a continuous ambient sound thing would not stop the
  sound until it was either overridden by more important sounds or disappeared
  out of range.
- Fixed: The bex include directive ignored the file name if it appeared in
  files that mark line endings with CR/LF instead of just LF. (AFAIK, that's
  all bex files that exist.) For files that just use LF, it would try to
  include the file but crash.
- Win32Video::EnumDDModesCB() now rejects modes whose widths are not
  multiples of 8, because there are various places in the source that assume
  this to be true, and I have no alternative code (or desire to write such
  code) to handle cases when this is not true. I don't know of any standard
  modes that would be rejected by this, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
- Fixed: Viewwindows with widths that are not divisible by 16 could crash
  when doubling pixels horizontally, because the MMX routines write to
  quadwords at a time. Now the non-MMX code is always used in such cases,
  since they are rare (only when the window is the full width of the screen
  and the screen width is not a multiple of 16).
- Removed vid_bufferarea and related code to switch between buffered and
  unbuffered display based on translucent areas visible in the last frame.
- Fixed: Savegames did not remember which levels had been marked visited for
  the Doom 1 intermission screen.
- Fixed: Actors' alphacolor was not serialized.
- Fixed vid_setmode not always resizing the window to a reasonable size under
  Win ME because the OS sends out WM_GETMINMAXINFO before performing the
  resize with SetWindowPos().

October 19, 2001
- Added the ability for DDrawFB to draw to a system memory surface and then
  blit it to the primary surface. This can greatly improve performance, both
  because the video card can write to its own memory faster than the CPU, but
  also because the next frame can start rendering in a separate surface while
  the blit is underway. The net result is that drawing to system memory is
  only a little slower than drawing directly to video memory (if at all), and
  there is really no reason for me to support writing directly to the primary
  surface any more. I can even run 1400x1050 at 35 fps, though it is somewhat
  jumpy, and it does get slower if the scene is too complicated. But just
  being able to run it full speed at all at that high a resolution rocks! Even
  a 300 MHz P2 can run the standard levels at a full 35 fps at 800x600, which
  it couldn't before.

October 18, 2001
- Need to fix windowed 256 color updating for systems that cannot lock the
  primary surface. (result is DDERR_CANTLOCKSURFACE when you try)
- Added a performance counter for blitting the frame buffer to the screen and
  discovered that it is a real performance sink. When no pixel format
  conversion is involved, it should be no slower than wall drawing, right? Well,
  it's about twice as slow.
- Improved performance at 1024x768 by using a pitch larger than the width for
  the underlying SimpleCanvas at that resolution (so that successive pixels
  drawn in columns are not exactly 1k apart and can make better use of the
  cache). The result is that wall pixels take about 5.4 cycles to draw, which
  is in line with what the other resolutions manage.

October 17, 2001
- Did some performance tests at different resolutions and discovered something
  very weird: up to and including 800x600, wall drawing ranges between 4.5 and
  5.2 cycles/pixel. But at 1024x768, it jumps up to a whopping 18 cycles per
  pixel. Even stranger, 1280x1024 only uses 7 cycles/pixel, and 1400x1050 takes
  just 5.5 cycles/pixel. (These numbers include all overhead such as traversing
  the BSP and creating visplanes, not just the time actually spent stuffing
  pixels to the framebufer.)
- Changed the mode iterator to allow resolutions taller than 1024 pixels,
  since there is nowhere in the source that this restriction exists. (There
  is a limit of 1200 pixels tall, but this is easily changed with a #define.)
- Massaged the assembly output of vlinec4 to produce vlinetallasm4. This
  new function is about 7% faster than provlineasm4 and is not limited to
  256 pixel tall columns, so I stopped using provlineasm4. I don't know
  how it compares to vlineasm4 on a Pentium, but my guess is that vlineasm4
  is faster on such a machine. It's probably worth also noting that contrary
  to my initial belief, self-modifying code was essential to getting this
  function to perform well. Also, I did not even bother trying to optimize
  it for a Pentium, just Pentium Pro and above. Moving things around to help
  pairing on a Pentium actually reduced performance on this P3-M.

October 15, 2001
- Wrote C versions of vlineasm1 and vlineasm4. On a P3, vlinec4 performs
  about half way between vlineasm4 and provlineasm4. P2 performance is
  probably similar.
- Got rid of all the 2-column drawers. Whatever performance improvements
  they might have been able to offer was negated by the complexity of the
  code neccessary to use them. This let me greatly clean up rt_draw4cols()
  and actually make it readable.

October 12, 2001
- Fixed: I_InitMusic() was not called if -nosound or -nosfx was passed.
- Changed visplanes so that the bottom array stores the pixels just below
  the plane--a simple semantic change that lends itself to a few more
  optimization chances elsewhere in the engine, since it unifies the way
  top and bottom arrays are handled everywhere.
- Enhanced wallscan so that it can get a texture column using any function.
  This lets me use it for layered skies.

October 10, 2001
- Drawing of a single sky layer now uses wallscan. 
- Removed the use of dc_mask from all of the non-wallscan column drawers,
  since they are only used for masked columns, which never repeat and hence
  never need masking.
- Tried out the new code on a P2-300. It is also slightly faster. Drawing a
  wall covering the entire screen is about 10ms faster at 800x600 on it. This
  made me decide to do away with BlastColumn, R_RenderSegLoop1, and
  R_RenderSegLoop2. There is just one R_RenderSegLoop now, using vlineasm4.

October 9, 2001
- Added Build's vlineasm4 and associated code to speed up wall drawing.
  Surprisingly, it only offers a marginal improvement on this P3-866 equipped
  notebook: The higher resolutions are only a few FPS faster than
  r_columnmethod 1. When I get a new monitor, I will have to try it out with
  my main system, since it still has a P2-350. I think the biggest benefit
  should be for people with Pentium-class or less processors.
  Since it is faster, I'll keep it. I also improved it so that it works with
  textures taller than 256 pixels (or should, I haven't tested).

October 4, 2001
- Fixed fullscreen video playback so that it does not minimize the game
  window immediately after the video is stopped.
- Improved dragging the ZDoom window around by making the window procedure
  pay attention to WM_PAINT messages and redraw the screen as needed. Making
  WM_SIZE invalidate the client rect also lets it redraw as the window is
  shrinking.

October 3, 2001
- Fixed DDrawFB::CreateSurfacesComplex() so that it can retry without
  requesting video memory. This lets it work with Mode X, so presumably it
  will also let it work with old video cards that lack proper DirectDraw
  support.
- Commented out the GammaControl stuff in win32video.cpp. Too many people
  complained about not being able to compile it (get a newer DX SDK!), and
  it does not provide me much benefit when working with paletted displays
  anyway. Nor was it ever actually implemented.

October 2, 2001
- Fixed: DROPPED bit was defined twice in DEHSUPP.
- Updated my source files with the new BSD-ish license.
- Renamed p_spark.cpp to g_shared/a_spark.cpp.
- Removed d_items.cpp and d_items.h. They have been obsolete ever since I
  changed the give command to accept class names.
- Changed the randomized sound names in DEHSUPP from their individual names
  to their new base name. (i.e. grunt/sight1, 2, and 3 all become grunt/sight)
- Fixed a typo in DEHSUPP: gatso/death should have been fatso/death.

October 1, 2001
- Added a playmovie command to play a file using DirectShow. Currently, it
  works best with windowed mode.

September 27, 2001
- Added Line_Horizon special to extend a sector's floor and ceiling to
  infinity--should be useful for skyboxes. It is not meant for use with
  slopes, so don't do that.
- Fixed: ceilingclip/floorclip generation in R_DrawSkyBoxes was wrong for
  unused portions of the sky box's visplane (when pl->top[x] == 0xffff).
  This could cause problems when taking the snapshot for savegames.
- Fixed: Quicksaving would continue to ask for a save slot until a normal
  save had been done.
- Fixed: Bad decal texture coordinates could crash the game. These were
  generated when the camera gets extremely close to a decal, so I chose to
  use the same tactic I used with masked mid textures and not render them
  at all if they get too close. I think the only time something like this
  becomes a real issue is when somebody is noclipping around the level.

- Fixed P_LoopSides() to not trash memory when loading a map with a
  single-sided line that does not attach to anything at its right end. (E1M3
  is one such map.)
- Fixed decals not drawing their full height except when they were on upper
  textures; BlastColumn was storing wallbottom wrong.
- Fixed inconsistant usage of ceilingclip. It is supposed to store the top
  good y, but some places still treated it as the y just above the first good
  y, as it was in the original renderer.
- Fixed the GCC version of qinterpolatedown16short(). It wrote 2 more
  entries than it was supposed to and could start writing one entry before
  it was supposed to.
- Previous log entries were accidentally lost when I was improving the
  todos/fromdos scripts. Now only the files that have changed get copied
  across, and I can avoid rebuilding every source file each time I transfer
  the code between partitions. Under Linux, this is a big deal, because GCC
  is so slow.

September 17, 2001
- Added cl_missiledecals cvar to turn off decals left behind by missile
  explosions.
- Added cl_bloodsplats cvar to turn off blood splats while leaving other
  decals alone.
- Added -timerdelay parameter to specify how fast the game timer tics (in
  milliseconds). This is just here so that when I occasionally get demos
  illustrating problems, I can easily fast forward through them.
- Made A3D the default for snd_3d again, because A3D has one more hardware
  channel than DirectSound on my Vortex2 and because it seems to work
  better than DirectSound.
- Changed I_StartSound3D() so that it starts sounds on a specific channel
  instead of using FSOUND_FREE, because it loses sounds with DirectSound
  if I let FMOD pick a channel. Oddly, FSOUND_FREE with A3D works fine.
  [Nevermind, that doesn't work with DirectSound, either. It seemed to be
  working the first time I tried it, but when I tried again later, it
  was not working anymore.] [Another footnote: A3D seems to position the
  sounds wrong that DirectSound does not play. What's going on?]
- Let I_SetChannels() change the number of channels available so that all
  the available hardware channels can be used if using 3D audio.
- Made CPU speed detection more accurate.
- Added underwater reverb for hardware 3D sound.
- Updated sound code for FMOD 3.4.
- Fixed timer resolution checking in WinMain--my parentheses were misplaced.
- Put SectorSilencer back at doomednum 9082. I don't know why I had changed
  it to 9002.

September 15, 2001
- Fixed: Monsters that reached the end of a patrol path did not have their
  reactiontime reset, so they would wait a very long time before attacking.
- Fixed: STYLE_Shaded ignored special colormaps like invulnerability.
- Added support for autoloading wads through the config file. Create a
  section called [Game.Autoload] and place "Path=<file>" beneath it for each
  file to be automatically loaded. They are loaded after the files in the
  skins directory and before any files on the command line. Game can be
  Global to load the files for any game. Global files are added before game-
  specific files.
- Fixed StreamSong when using 3D sound: The stream was not created with
  FSOUND_2D, so it was being positioned in the world.

September 14, 2001
- Made the ACS spawn and spawnspot commands automatically prepend A to their
  type names. They remain untested, however.
- Added decals for all remaining Doom things. Heretic is next.
- Fixed pitch calculation in P_TraceBleed() when a missile's velocity is used
  to determine pitch.

September 12, 2001
- Added decal stretchers, sliders, combiners, and colorchangers. Also added
  a few more decals.

September 11, 2001
- Fixed FDecalLib::GetDecalByNum() and ::GetDecalByName() so that they do not
  crash if the decal is not found.
- Tried putting back in the BSP-based sight checking code that was in the
  Linux Doom 1.10 source, and the result was quite surprising. Using the BSP
  to check sight was actually slower than using the blockmap, sometimes
  significantly so--Vrack 2 spent between 4 and 6 times as much time checking
  site using the BSP as it did without. In the best case, the BSP routines
  were about as fast as the blockmap ones, so I took the BSP routines back
  out, because they offer no benefit over the Hexen code I had been using for
  some time now.
- Fixed: Maps with starts for players 5-8 would trample over memory
  when saving the starts for those players.
- Added blood splats for instant hit weapons.

September 10, 2001
- Made alpha affect STYLE_Shade.
- Fixed: rt_shaded4cols sometimes drew texels too dark because it
  calculated the value of fill wrong.
- Fixed: Decals that used picnums (i.e. all of them) could not be flipped
  horizontally.
- Stopped using actors' memory locations as their phase shift for float
  bob motion. This works fine for single player, but in multiplayer,
  there's no way to ensure that the same actor will have the same phase
  on different machines. Now I use the random number generator instead.

September 8, 2001
- Added decal faders so that decals that are likely to bog things down
  (such as the plasma rifle's) can disappear sooner than if they wait for
  cl_maxdecals to be hit and get cycled out. [Edit: I only use these for
  special effect decals right now.]
- Added the ability for missiles to leave behind decals on walls.
- Fixed a sub-pixel alignment problem for vertically flipped sprites.
- Fixed: Adding bots and then changing the map could crash because the bot's
  "player" was still carrying around the actor from the previous level.
- Bumped the barrel respawn time back up to 1050 tics--forgot I had dropped
  it down to 50 for testing.
- Added support for loading sounds from RFF files so that I can have the
  Bloodbath announcer.

September 7, 2001
- Fixed: Dehacked patches that set weapons to ammo type 5 (what was once
  am_noammo) would use am_crossbow, because that is type 5 now.

September 5, 2001
- Fixed: Trying to alias a command through the .ini file would crash
  because the game would actually try to do it instead of giving a warning.

September 4, 2001
- Added the falling splat sound to A_PlayerScream().
- Changed skin semantics in AActor::SetState() again so that players can
  actually burn because the burn states use the FDTH sprite instead of
  the normal player sprite. Now, if the actor is not a player, or the
  player does not have a skin, or the state's sprite is not the same as
  the sprite the player was spawned with, the state's sprite will be
  used. Otherwise, the skin's sprite will be used.
- Fixed burning and icy deaths to not crash.
- Fixed a stack overflow in Heretic/Hexen that could happen after death
  because A_Chase and A_Look would repeatedly cause the other function
  to execute, ad nauseum.
- Added Hexen's Ice Guy/Ice Golem.
- The SkyboxViewPoint's angle is now used to adjust the yaw when drawing
  a skybox. This means you can rotate a skybox by rotating its viewpoint
  (which is courrently only possible with an actor mover and several
  overlapping interpolation points).
- Added simple Dolby Pro Logic surround support to s_sound.cpp using code
  from a post on the message board.

September 3, 2001
- Fixed: The alias command will no longer try to set or remove aliases for
  normal console commands.
- Fixed an error in C_RemoveTabCommand() that moved one extra name down
  at the end of the array.
- Added Hexen's Serpent/Water Lurker, Centaur, Demons, and mana.

September 1, 2001
- Reintroduced MF_CRASHED, this time as MF3_CRASHED, so that I don't need a
  special case to crash FireDemons that die on the floor.
- Added Hexen's FireDemon/Fire Gargoyle/Imp, just because it's been so long
  since I added anything from Hexen.

August 29, 2001
- Changed ADecal::StickToWall() to add decals to the end of the list so that
  new decals get drawn on top of old ones.
- Fixed: Actors with STYLE_None were still being projected to the screen,
  needlessly wasting time.

August 28, 2001
- Fixed: Quicksaving into an existing slot would rename the quicksave to the
  name of whatever was saved most recently instead of keeping the name
  of the quicksave slot unchanged.
- Fixed: PWADs that replaced sprite frames that originally only had a rotation
  0 with multiple rotations would only show the first rotation.
- Fixed: When the light to dark part of R_CalcTiltedLighting() clamped the
  end of the range, it set lightfiller to a value calculated with
  (NUMCOLORMAPS-1)<<FRACBITS. FRACBITS should have been COLORMAPSHIFT. The
  result was strange colors at best and crashes at worst.
- Fixed: Shuffling playlists crashed because I failed to clamp the result
  of rand() to the number of songs in the playlist. Whoops!
- Changed R_SetupFrame() so that the chasecam will only be used if the
  current camera has an image.
- Changed Win32 mouse grabbing so that when the mouse becomes ungrabbed,
  it will return to the same place it was at before being grabbed.
- Changed win32/i_input.cpp so that deactivating the window will pause the
  game if the player is not in a network game.
- Fixed Thing_Destroy to just hurt things enough to kill them instead of
  giving them 10000 damage like massacre does. (This is the way it is
  supposed to be.) For people who liked the accidental behavior, I added a
  second argument that can be used to enable the massacre-like effect.
- Fixed some entries to doomxlat.txt: Generalized floors and ceilings
  can be set to allow monster activation now. Changed the delays for
  generalized doors so that they more closely match the actual tic counts
  used by BOOM instead of rounding them to the nearest second.
- Fixed: Palette flashes were not carried over when creating a new frame
  buffer. Also fixed palette flashes being gamma adjusted multiple times
  whenever the framebuffer resources need to be recreated.
- Fixed: After adding 16 sprite rotations, the player setup menu showed
  the side view instead of the back view.

August 20, 2001
- Fixed: Sprite frames beyond P were always flipped.

August 18, 2001
- Fixed some sizes in Net_SkipCommand()--should elimate some out of sync
  errors.
- Reimplemented "give weapons" by having it silently spawn each weapon under
  the player and faking a touch so that the player picks it up. Similarly,
  the give command can now be passed actor names and will function like a
  summon that automatically picks up the item spawned.
- Changed Win32Video::GoFullscreen() and Win32Video::CreateFrameBuffer() so
  that they try harder to allow the game to continue without putting up an
  error. This is not tested very well, because I never had any problems with
  it. Hopefully it will work as desired.
- Changed DDrawFB::Update() and DDrawFB::Unlock() so that calling Update() when
  the LockCount is greater than 1 no longer bombs out with an error. Instead,
  it sets a flag that tells Unlock() to call Update() the next time LockCount
  would drop from 1 to 0. This allows Update() to be safely used as an Unlock()
  when the image on screen is desired to be updated but it cannot be
  guaranteed that there is only one lock on the surface.
- Changed R_SetupFrame() to not use floorz and ceilingz to clip viewz, because
  not everything that can be viewed through sets these. (Specifically, moving
  cameras do not touch them, and there's really no reason to bother setting
  them, because they're more for physics than rendering.
- New: DDrawFB::LockSurf() is not required to successfully lock the frame
  buffer. This should help computers where Alt-Tab did not work before (though
  I cannot test it myself, because I never had problems with it).
- Remembered why I didn't use DIK_PAUSE as the pause key. DirectInput support
  for the pause key is not universal, so I have to use the standard Windows
  messages to detect it. Moved KEY_PAUSE back to 255, where I had it before.
- Fixed: Quickload crashed if a game had not previously been quicksaved in the
  same session.

August 16, 2001
- S_StartSound() keeps track of the sound id passed to it before it
  follows links, so now S_GetSoundPlayingInfo() can use that to determine if
  a sound is playing or not without having to resolve links.
- Changed GrabMouse_Win32() to restrict the pointer to the window's client
  rect and not the window's entire rect so the user can't accidentally click
  buttons in the window's title bar while moving the mouse rapidly.
- WndProc() now catches WM_MOVE and WM_SIZE messages to better ease
  transitions to/from fullscreen when not using DirectInput.
- Fixed: The mouse was not being grabbed if DirectInput was selected with
  in_mouse. I just added "NativeMouse = true;" to the beginning of
  I_InitInput() to force I_CheckNativeMouse() to grab the mouse when it
  gets called.
- Fixed: A_CorpseExplode used the exploding actor as the base for CorpseBit
  frames and not the CorpseBit itself.

August 15, 2001
- Fixed: The wind sound in Hexen played wrong because it used
  S_GetSoundPlayingInfo(), which has no way of following sound links. And now
  that I have random sounds, I can't think of an easy way to make it work with
  those. Fixed it by adding S_IsActorPlayingSomething() and using that
  instead. Changed a few other places that called S_GetSoundPlayingInfo() to
  match.
- Fixed: Animating flats with an ANIMDEFS lump was broken.
- Fixed: The values returned by MakeKey() changed with each rebuild because
  I was using the address of get_crc_table() as the CRC table instead of
  actually calling the function to get the CRC table's location. Now klook and
  mlook hash uniquely without any need for twiddling the return value from
  the CRC routine.
- Changed falling damage so that it can't kill you if you have god mode on.
- Added the filterstarts mapinfo flag to enable filtering out player starts
  based on skill/gametype.
- Fixed: Redefining sounds with a random list (whether it had one before or
  not) would cause problems because I was still sorting the S_rnd array--a
  remnant from the time when random lists were found by using binary search
  on S_rnd instead of by following the sound's link field.
- Added the sv_ihatesounds cvar for people who think they should be able
  to shut up the BFG by landing on the ground. It forces all sounds to
  use channel 1 instead of their preferred channel.
- Changed crushing ceilings to not restart their sound sequences each time
  they reach the top or bottom of their path.
- Added a tag argument to S_StopSoundID() so that it only stops sounds in
  a certain group. For my purposes, a group is currently defined as "any
  sectors with the same tag." Actors do not utilise sound groups.
- Removed S_CheckSound().
- Added entries to DOOMX and HERETICX to make mirrors and slopes possible
  without using the Hexen map format. Also added some of EDGE's default
  linetypes for scrolling, translucency, and 2-unit floor raising.

August 12, 2001
- Changed the algorithm in W_LumpNameHash() and MakeKey() to a CRC32
  algorithm because it hashes better. The only problem was that using a CRC,
  klook and mlook both have the same CRC value, so I had to twiddle MakeKey
  a little to give them unique keys.

August 11, 2001
- Added support for sprite frames with 16 rotations ala EDGE. The assignment
  of rotations is the same as for EDGE: 1,9,2,A,3,B,4,C,5,D,6,E,7,F,8,G.
- Changed the music streamers to use FSOUND_Stream_Play3DAttrib because of a
  report that they were actually being positioned with snd_3d true. I can't
  use snd_3d under NT, where I do most of my development, so I don't know if
  it made a difference or not.
- Fixed music recognition so that wave files can be played as music.
- Fudged about with slope handling in AActor::RunThink and P_CheckSlopeWalk
  in an effort to let the player walk on some steep slopes that are not very
  far off the surrounding ground. It is a big hack. I do not like it.

August 10, 2001
- Fixed drawing of rotated, scaled, and sloped flats.
- Fixed: PCD_PRINTNUMBER did not update the stack pointer.

August 8, 2001
- Fixed drawing of scaled and sloped flats.
- Restored the default radius and height for AInvisibleBridge, since it can no
  longer inherit them from ABridge (which sets them at game start time).

August 4, 2001
- The alwaysfake modification for R_FakeFlat() did not work as intended, so I
  removed it. The changes Lee Killough made for MBF seem to be good enough.
- Added new Thing_Destroy semantics: a tid of 0 will kill all monsters in the
  level, just like the massacre cheat.
- Changed the friendly fire check in P_DamageMobj from (target != source) to
  (target->player != source->player). This is just so that voodoo doll damage
  cannot be reduced by turning on teamplay and changing teamdamage.

August 2, 2001
- Fixed: Items were respawning at the location where they were picked up when
  they should have respawned where the level author placed them on the map.
- Changed the criteria for executing thing death specials from MF_COUNTKILL to
  !MF_SPECIAL. Now you can give a barrel a special, and it will be executed when
  the barrel is destroyed.
- Added the print command to print a string from the string table.
- Added the contributed Italian translation.
- Fixed: OB_UNDEAD said "revevant" instead of "revenant".
- Added names for all the new keys I found when looking at the dinput.h from
  the DX8 SDK.
- Fixed: Bindings for kp= would not save in the ini file properly.
- Added rebind command to change the binding of the key that activated it.
  This is intended to allow the creation of generic sequential aliases. (That
  is, a series of aliases that do something, then bind a key to the next alias
  in the sequence.) Like this:
	alias dumb1 "echo one; rebind dumb2"
	alias dumb2 "echo two; rebind dumb1"

July 26, 2001
- Fixed the TMulScale<x> definitions for GCC.

July 25, 2001
- In I_InitSound(), A3D is no longer the default if snd_3d is true.
- Moved s_sfxvolume, s_midivolume, and s_musicvolume into their appropriate
  i_* files and integrated them with the functions they called. Also made
  their ranges uniform at [0.0,1.0].

July 23, 2001
- Added some more checks to p_setup.cpp to catch bad maps. In this
  case, the checks were added for ma_sincity.wad, which has two one-
  sided linedefs that have -1 as their front sector and will crash if
  you look at them.

June 8, 2001
- Fixed: Single files added with -file were recorded with their lump
  names instead of the file names so if they got closed, they could
  not be reopened.

June 3, 2001
- Finished TiMidity++ support for the Win32 version. It has two modes
  of operations: 1) Just play as normal. This only works if the sound
  card can play multiple wave streams at a time. 2) The default, have
  TiMidity output wave data through a pipe and use that to fill an
  FMOD stream. This will work with all sound cards and offers a little
  more control over the output. The only problem I could not figure out
  how to solve was how to make TiMidity quit (safely) when ZDoom wants
  it to without modifying TiMidity. The solution I ended up using was to
  have TiMidity start a thread that waits on a special named event and
  calls exit when the event becomes signalled.
    Ironically, the whole purpose of being able to use TiMidity for music
  was that it could provide better music support under Linux, yet the
  Linux side of things has not even been done yet. When I do write it, it
  should work fine with an unmodified TiMidity.

June 1, 2001
- Put back the "<type> operator *()" members of the different cvar
  classes because VC++ always uses a bitwise copy when passing a class
  to a varargs function EVEN IF THE COPY CONSTRUCTOR IS DEFINED. This
  means that something like printf ("%d", dmflags); will actually copy
  dmflags to the stack instead of just dmflag's value. To make it work
  as expected, you need to use printf ("%d", (int)dmflags);. Since
  printf ("%d", *dmflags); is more compact, I decided operator * is
  useful after all.
  I just hope the timidity cvars are the only ones I used with printf
  style functions. I did not see any others when I scanned the source,
  but that doesn't mean I didn't miss any. :-(
- Changed the name of the variable passed to cvar callbacks from "var"
  to "self" to make its use more obvious.
- Changed the "<type> operator *()" of the different cvar types to
  "operator <type> ()" so that fetching a cvar's value looks just like
  fetching any other variable's value.

May 30, 2001
- Added snd_midiprecache cvar so that people without GUSes can turn off
  the precaching.
- Fixed: snd_surround was ignored.
- Fixed: snd_reset turned off MIDI.
- Added assembly routines for the different r_detail settings.

May 28, 2001
- Fixed: LEVEL_SPECOPENDOOR opened the door at a speed of 8*TICRATE instead
  of 8*FRACUNIT, about 1872 times slower than it should have been.

May 26, 2001
- Fixed the positioning of y-doubled view windows and changed the x-doubling
  so that it works with the optimized column drawer and does not need the
  columnofs table.
- Fixed: M_FindResponseFile had a poor parser that considered lots of things
  to be white space that weren't and did not treat quotes specially. Now it
  uses essentially the same parser as the console.
- Fixed Heretic/Hexen wind specials so that they can apply even when an
  actor's current velocity is 0.
- Added MF3_NOBLOCKMONST flag to indicate which things can cross
  ML_BLOCKMONSTERS lines (because this is a better way than writing a
  special case for Heretic's APod).
- Removed MaxSpecialCross, since it isn't needed anymore.

May 25, 2001
- Fixed: ATreeDestructible's default list was missing the mass property.
- Added Hexen's falling damage code and made the two types of falling damage
  (ZDoom or Hexen) selectable from the level and dmflags. The dmflags falling
  damage selector can now be used to enable falling damage but not to disable
  it to avoid cheating in levels meant to be played with falling damage.
- Added a new dmflag (sv_nopassover) to make thing z-checking work as it
  did in Doom (that is, not at all, except for missiles).
- Fixed: Chat macros did not work because Windows sends WM_SYSCHAR instead of
  WM_CHAR when ALT is held down.

May 14, 2001
- Added decal groups and generators to DECALDEF.
- Fixed potential crash when defining decals with SpawnIDs.

May 3, 2001
- Added lightning scripts, which get executed whenever lightning strikes in
  a level.
- Added the OutdoorLightning sector special (197) so that skyboxes can
  flash outdoor (as opposed to indoor) lightning without fancy scripts.

May 2, 2001
- Fixed: When teleporting in a non-hub environment, the level's snapshot
  would stay around if the player had saved while in it. This was especially
  obvious if the player was moving to the same map he just left.
- Enabled key repeating in the menus.
- Added Hexen's lightning and fixed a bug in Hexen's code: It is not safe
  to assume that the number of sectors that lightning can apply to will
  remain constant through the level (thanks to ACS).

May 1, 20001
- Fixed: The SkyBox member of sector_t was not serialized.

April 26, 2001
- Fixed: When loading savegames, bobbing actors would have semi-random
  heights because they get loaded in a different memory address than they
  were saved at. The actor's address is used to determine its phase shift
  compared to other bobbing actors, so when the actor was restored there
  was no way to restore the original cycle. The solution is to take out the
  bob offset before saving and add it back in when restoring.
- Added some DrawChar functions to DCanvas.
- Fixed DCanvas::StringWidth() for high ASCII characters.
- Changed the arrangement of codes in ESpecialGUIKeys to document the
  standard ASCII codes in the range [1,31].
- Changed text color escape character from 0x81 to 0x1c, because 0x81 is a
  printable character (though most Windows fonts seem to leave it undefined).
- Added support for WM_CHAR messages (they get fired off as EV_GUI_Char), so
  now you can do all the standard Windows text manipulation stuff when typing
  text at the console or elsewhere.
- Fixed: Decals were being saved to savegames but were not restored properly.
  I think this was also causing crash problems after loading savegames.
- Changed mouse pointer hiding to change the cursor to an invisible cursor
  instead of changing its visibility. This is to ensure that it works
  correctly all the time instead of just most of the time.
- Removed testing for WM_ACTIVATE in the window procedure. Looking for
  input focus is what we really want to do where the window's active status
  was being checked.
- Got rid of I_Pause/ResumeMouse() and let the code in i_input.cpp decide
  whether or not the pointer should be visible.

April 25, 2001
- Changed action command handling so that multiple keys bound to the same
  action can coexist peacefully. That is, if you are pressing two keys bound
  to the same action and release one of them, the action will still persist
  until the second key is also released. This is like Quake.
- Added a check for key bindings to check if a binding contains the substring
  "bind". Only if it does is the binding copied before being executed.
  Previously, the command was always copied, even if it was unneccessary.
- Changed C_DoCommand()'s argument to a const char *.

April 24, 2001
- Changed command line handling for console commands so that argv and argc
  are not calculated until the first time they are needed.

April 23, 2001
- Added shuffle parameter to playlist command.

April 22, 2001
- Added playlistprev and playlistnext commands.
- Pressing F1 at the save/load menu replaces the comment with the actual
  file name of the savegame.
- Added GK_ entries for the function keys.
- Fixed: Quicksaving without saving/loading first crashed.
- Added reverse tab-completion to the console, when pressing Shift-Tab.

April 21, 2001
- Fixed: P_GiveAmmo() did not check userinfo.neverswitch before setting the
  pendingweapon.
- Got rid of P_GiveWeapon() and moved its functionality into AWeapon::
  TryPickup() and added some more AWeapon member functions just so that
  picking up a weapon with sv_weaponstay true will produce all the standard
  pickup feedback. This breaks the "give weapons" cheat, but you can still
  summon them, so how bad is that really?
- Changed P_GroupLines() to warn about lines that lack frontsectors instead of
  crashing.

April 20, 2001
- Fixed: In Heretic and Hexen, things are supposed to gib at negative half
  their original health.

April 17, 2001
- Fixed: It was possible to stand at the very edge of a steep slope and not
  fall off of it. It is still possible to "balance" by running away from the
  edge, but I think that will take more time to fix than it's worth (especially
  if I really do go ahead and rewrite the level geometry collision detection.)
- Added in-air friction that depends on aircontrol: The greater aircontrol is,
  the more friction affects things. Only affects players.
- Made level gravity and aircontrol accessible through MAPINFO as well as ACS.
- Disabled migration of zdoom.cfg. Perhaps it is better to make a clean break
  from the old format than to try and import it if zdoom.ini is not found.
- Fixed: When the status bar face graphic changed and the status bar was
  scaled, only the area enclosing the new graphic was updated to the screen.
  It should update the entire face box.
- Fixed: When a dehacked/bex patch changed a level's name, the change was not
  reflected in the level infos, so it did not actually become visible.

April 14, 2001
- Modified S_LookupPlayerSound() to detect player sounds which were defined
  but did not have any valid lumps and automatically try again using male.
- Added storesavepic cvar.
- Added sorting to the savegame menus.
- Finally tested the savegame menus to make sure that they work with more
  save games than are visible and discovered that they didn't, so I fixed
  them so they do work.
- DCanvas::StringWidth() now knows about '\n' characters and returns the
  length of the longest line.
- Changed the savegame menus to display games saved with an incompatible
  ZDoom version so that the user has a more convenient means of deleting them
  than by opening the savegames in a hex editor to find out which version each
  one was saved with.
- Added "name" support to archives. Basically, names are just managed strings
  that allow duplicates to be stored by index instead of duplicating the
  string.

April 13, 2001
- Fixed: Particles were rendered as if they were being drawn to the main
  frame buffer, even when they weren't.
- Fixed: After deleting the last save game, the menu would think you still
  had a game selected and crashed if you tried to delete again.
- Discovered the problem with some of Tei Tenga's cameras: They have invalid
  heights that put them above/below the sector. Copied the viewz clamping
  from P_CalcHeight() into R_SetupFrame() to compensate. I don't know why
  they worked in earlier versions.
- Moved zvox.wad loading to happen after loading the IWAD. There are certain
  places where the IWAD is assumed to be the second wad loaded.

April 12, 2001
- Added a new game menu for Hexen that explains you cannot start Hexen from
  a menu yet.
- Made the names stored in DEHSUPP case-insensitive.
- Fixed: R_RenderViewToCanvas() did not lower the Heretic weapons to the
  bottom of the rendered area.
- Fixed positioning of the save/load menu titles and the save game cursor
  at high resolutions.
- Fixed: Many ammo types were derived from AInventory and not AAmmo, so
  they did not play the dedicated ammo-pickup sound.
- Fixed AAmbientSound::Activate() to check that the ambient sound assigned
  to it actually exists. If not, it destroys itself.
- Changed doomtype.h to use the ANSI <limits.h> instead of defining its
  own limits.

April 10, 2001
- Fixed: FindNextFileA() returns 0 on failure, which is the opposite of
  _findnext(), and I did not realise that when I changed I_FindNext()
  to use the Win32 API function.

April 9, 2001
- Made some code changes to allow for compilation with GCC again
  (specifically, Cygwin's GCC). Fixed a few latent bugs in the process,
  thanks to GCC's more stringent default warnings.
- Fixed: FHelperThread must have a virtual destructor, which might
  explain why I was having so much trouble with it before.

April 7, 2001
- Added r_drawtrans cvar to allow disabling the drawing of translucent
  things.
- Fixed: The stretched Doom status bar would not properly clear away the
  big ammo count when switching to a weapon that does not use ammo.
- Fixed: At certain screen heights, scaled status bars would not touch the
  bottom of the screen because of inaccuracy in the calculation of ::ST_Y
  in DBaseStatusBar::SetScaled().
- Added separate pickup sounds for health, armor, and ammo items.
- Improved sound link resolution in S_StartSound() so that regular sounds
  can alias player sounds.
- Reimplemented idmypos in a more useful manner.

April 3, 2001
- Fixed: DLevelScript::RunScript() sets TeleportSide according to its
  lineSide property instead of assuming that it is already set correctly.
- Fixed: ASectorAction::CheckTrigger() should set TeleportSide to 0 so that
  teleports always work.

March 29, 2001
- Added language cvar.
- Fixed: Float bobbing objects would warp to the floor when on a rising
  platform.
- Fixed: "Torque" should not be applied to float bob objects. (Hexen MAP11
  is a good example of why not.)
- Fixed: Spree messages should only be shown in deathmatch.
- Changed sound effect loading to try the sound as DMX format first instead
  of last. (FMOD was recognizing CHICPK2 in heretic.wad as some compressed
  format.)
- Made skins work with the new player sound system.

March 28, 2001
- Changed player sounds to exist separately from the main sound list (sort
  of). The generic player sounds (e.g. "*death") now exist as actual sound
  entries, but they only serve as a context for getting an index into a
  separate list of class/gender specific sounds which index back into the
  main sound list and provide the actual sound to play. This also reduces
  the total number of sounds that need to be registered. Several new SNDINFO
  commands were introduced to support this.
- Fixed: When the tomed phoenix rod ran out of flame, the weapon disappeared.
- Fixed: Intensity calculations in InitPalette() could overflow and cause
  the invulnerability colormap to be wrong.

March 27, 2001
- Made the Ambients array in s_advsound.cpp a list of pointers to
  AmbientSounds instead of a container of AmbientSounds, since the array is
  usually nowhere near full and just wasting memory.

March 26, 2001
- Fixed: Using sound names in a dehacked Thing section works again.
- Enhanced the soundlist command to show links and random lists.
- Added an overloaded Printf() that does not take a print level, but just
  prints at PRINT_HIGH.
- Added the $random SNDINFO command.
- Moved the template functions into templates.h and added the BinarySearch
  template function.
- Fixed: The spectre had sounds defined in SNDINFO, but its defaults didn't
  specify any sounds, so it used the demon's sounds instead.
- Implemented a suggestion from the message board to A_VileChase so that
  negative speed archviles do not run away from corpses.

March 24, 2001
- Fixed: Monsters following a patrol path would not have their reactiontime
  reset to 0 if they heard a player before seeing her.
- Fixed: Picking up a thing by walking over it would remove it from the
  blocklist and make it possible to walk into another thing near it, because
  the P_BlockThingsIterator would not find anymore actors in that block for
  that call.
- Tried making DThinker::Delete() private so as to enforce the "use Destroy
  with thinkers" rule, but it didn't work. If the object's constructor can
  throw an exception, the caller of new needs to be able to call delete in
  order to remove the partially constructed object. However, I did change
  the definition of DECLARE_STATELESS_ACTOR so that all actors have nothrow
  constructors (since they're not allowed to use a constructor), which should
  help reduce the size of a lot of the CreateObject()s.
- Split the Thinkers list into two in order to guarantee that every thinker
  will have a chance to think during the same tic when it is created.
- Fixed: A thinker that destroyed itself in PostBeginPlay() would block the
  ticks for all actors after it for that game tic.

March 23, 2001
- Fixed: Float bobbing was not properly centered around the object's "ideal"
  height.
- Added A_SPosAttackUseAtkSound(). This is the same as A_SPosAttack(), except
  it plays the actor's attack sound instead of being hardcoded to play
  "shotguy/attack". Now changing spider/attack in SNDINFO can have an effect.

March 22, 2001
- Wrote a fully-functional gccinlines.h compatible with GCC 2.95.

March 20, 2001
- Undid: When I made float bobbing work for variable heights, I started
  clamping bobbing objects to the floor/ceiling. Heretic and Hexen do not do
  this, so I stopped clamping them.
- Fixed: P_BloodSplatter() should only be called for Raven's games, not Doom.
- Changed sound ID 0 to mean "no sound" instead of -1.
- Changed actor default sounds from strings to IDs so that I don't have to
  worry about tracking a bunch of pointers when loading/saving games, because
  this information gets saved out now.
- Fixed: Midtextures on two-sided lines are not drawn if they pass too close
  to the player. What is considered "too close" was determined empirically.
- Fixed typo: Wizard's spawnhealth should be 180, not 100.
- Turned off monsters killing other monsters when the player is dead and
  the game is Doom.
- Added global ACS variables. These are like world variables, except they
  do not get cleared when moving to a new hub.
- Reduced the ACS stack size from 200 to 64.

March 19, 2001
- Added a list of needed wads to savegames.
- Moved the SAVESTRINGSIZE definition into version.h so that I can be
  sure all the files that use it use the same value. One file had it
  at 32, and the rest used 24, which was causing crashes when switching
  levels after saving a game.
- Fixed a Doom bug: If a boss eye tried to shoot a cube at a boss target
  with the same y-coordinate as itself, the game would crash with a divide
  by 0 because only the difference in y-coordinates was used to determine
  how long it would take for the cube to reach the target.

March 17, 2001
- Rewrote the save and load menus to support the new savegame features and
  to also support far more files than before.
- Fixed: The patch drawers in v_draw.cpp crashed with patches that had
  useless 0-length posts.
- Fixed: Sound sequence SS_CMD_END was being generated wrong.
- Fixed: Sound sequences with no current sound were archived wrong.

March 16, 2001
- Added screenshots to save games, ala all the Build games I've played.
  Also added comments that currently just indicate the time when the game
  was saved.
- Added R_RenderViewToCanvas() and rearranged r_main.cpp a little to
  accomodate it.

March 15, 2001
- Added page up/down support for long options menus (i.e. controls menu).
- Changed console paging keys: Ctrl-Home and Ctrl-End now move to top/bottom
  of console buffer, and Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown move up/down by
  pages.
- Fixed: Trace() picked PT_ADDTHINGS based on ActorMask instead of actorMask.
  The most obvious consequence of this was that hitscan weapons worked
  sporadicly with the chasecam on.
- Fixed: Backpack was only giving one of each ammo type instead of one clip
  of each ammo type.

March 14, 2001
- Added MBF "torque" to fix "The items that the monsters drop when they die
  sometimes float in the air (happens very often when the monsters die in
  stairs)." Although it does fix this, I think it looks goofy to see ammo
  clips go careening down the stairs at the beginning of MAP01. The better
  solution to this particular situation would probably be to adjust the
  pickupable items' radii to accurately reflect their physical sizes, but
  I fear that might make them harder to grab. Maybe if they were noclip?
- Fixed dumpmapthings command.
- Space tuning: Shrank FState from 28 to 16 bytes.
- Fixed spree and multikill messages to correctly display the killer.
- Fixed DPusher::ChangeValues() to properly convert from byte angles to
  fineangles.
- Added PROP_STATE_BASE to AMaceFX3's defaults, so that it gets the right
  death state.

March 11, 2001
- Changed bex string section handling to simulate old death messages
  (without %o and %k).
- Added support for international characters to the FFont class and also
  added some corresponding characters to zdoom.wad.
- Changed Heretic/Hexen font loading to use name plates like Doom fonts
  instead of FONTA/FONTB markers, because templates allow for gaps in the
  character set.
- Tweaked string loading so that variant-neutral strings are loaded before
  loading strings from any variant of the specified language.
- Toned down the alpha on BFG and plasma projectiles.
- Changed rocket explosions back to STYLE_Translucent.
- Fixed ADEF_SkipSuper handling, though I wonder if it wouldn't be better
  to rework the situations that use it, so it isn't needed at all.
- Fixed: Music for Doom 1 was wrong.
- Fixed: The cast finale was messed up.
- Fixed: The new actor members were not being serialized.
- Fixed: None of the new actor fields were being serialized.
- Fixed: The FState * serializer did not use TAutoSegIterator.
- Fixed: Dehacked monsters could be really slow, because monsters speeds
  are now fixed point but weren't before.
- Fixed: M_QuitDOOM() was not getting DOSY through GStrings.
- Fixed: Stringlist did not write out enough information in the name table,
  so FStringTable could not figure out which index belonged to which name.
- Fixed: String names were not loaded before using a bex string section.

March 9, 2001
- Added PCD_SETTHINGSPECIAL and its analagous Skull Tag special,
  Thing_SetSpecial.
- Added obituary messages for the Heretic monsters.
- Added %o and %k substitutions for obituaries, ala Unreal.
- Fixed: Player obituaries were not being displayed unless it was a player
  who did the killing.
- Extended SexMessage() to handle %o and %k.
- Fixed: tmfloorsector was being calculated wrong, which could cause
  problems moving around in slopy areas.
- Replaced all the DivScale30() calls in WallMost() to SafeDivScale30().

March 8, 2001
- Wrote support for the string tables into the game, which shrank it 28k
  (but only because the text data got moved into the wad).

March 7, 2001
- Wrote a tool to compile localized string tables.

March 5, 2001
- Fixed: PTR_TraceIterator expected to be able to cross closed sectors. That
  is, when it stepped across a two-sided line, it assumed that the next line
  in sequence would belong to the sector it had stepped into.
- Fixed: P_SightTraverseIntercepts() needs to set up openbottom and opentop
  before calling PTR_SightTraverse so that the results of P_CheckSight()
  are always defined.
- Fixed: Using include in bex patches caused the DehSupp data to be freed
  prematurely.
- Got the code to fully compile again with default lists. The executable is
  only 104k smaller than before (I had hoped for something more dramatic),
  but at least now it only takes one minute to link the release build.

February 28, 2001
- Changed the console command implementation so that new commands do not
  require subclasses (and all the function overhead that goes with them).
- Finished building default lists for every actor.

February 27, 2001
- Began the tedious process of converting to actor default lists.
- Simplified the IMPLEMENT_CLASS macros to not require the parent type
  because that information can be derived thanks to the DECLARE_CLASS macros.
- Removed the distinction between serializable and non-serializable DObjects
  so only objects that do some specific serialization actually need
  Serialize() methods.
- Fixed: Teleport_EndGame works again.
- Added WALLF_NOAUTODECALS flag to sidedefs, so certain lines will not
  get impact decals (bullet holes) on them, specifically: scrolling walls.
- Increased the precision of P_InterceptVectors so that it can handle longer
  lines.

February 26, 2001
- Added limitpainelemental cvar to control whether or not Pain Elementals
  will limit their attacks based on the number of Lost Souls in the level.

Feburary 24, 2001
- Fixed some class serializers that did not call their superfunction.

February 23, 2001
- Changed P_DropItem() so that negative special values will not be stored in
  the item's health field. This is primarily to support exoteric DeHackEd
  patches, as it doesn't matter under normal circumstances.

February 22, 2001
- Removed the ClassInit class, and made TypeInfo constructors register
  themselves, saving around 20k.
- Fixed: Places that use P_SpawnMissile() and then manipulate the missile
  somehow now check for NULL returns.
- Fixed: AMovingCamera::Serialize() did not call its superfunction.
  This is an oversight I keep making, so I added some code to DObject and
  FArchive to look for this error.

February 20, 2001
- Fixed: Normal skies did not reflect in mirrors, and sky boxes mostly failed
  to be drawn at all in mirrors.

February 19, 2001
- Added PCD_PUSHBYTES and PCD_PUSHxBYTES p-codes to ACS, since PCD_PUSHBYTE
  was a fairly common sequence.

February 17, 2001
- Made G_DoLoadLevel() remove any existing HUD messages.
- Made BLOCKMAP lumps optional (sort of--the lump still needs to be there,
  but it can be length 0).
- Rearranged P_SetupLevel() so that a map's behavior is loaded before
  anything else (in order to make enter scripts work when a map is just
  loaded).
- Changed I_RegisterSong() to not bother loading a song if -nomusic.
- Added support for these Skull Tag script types: Death, Enter, and Respawn.
- Added cl_showsprees and cl_showmultikills cvars.
- Fixed: A_Look made stealth monsters visible.
- Fixed: BlurSphere needs to be STYLE_Translucent for the pulse to be
  visible.
- Fixed: StealthDemon was STYLE_Add instead of STYLE_Translucent.
- Fixed: Col2RGB8_2 needs to have cover most entries from Col2RGB8, not just
  half of them..
- Fixed: Net_SkipCommand() was still calculating the length of
  DEM_SINFCHANGED based on the old semantics.
- Changed startup command processing again. Now, all commands are processed
  at once, but ones considered "not safe" to be executed before everything
  is set up will have their execution delayed.

February 15, 2001
- Changed autoexec.cfg parsing to be similar to command line parsing.
  All sets are run as soon as possible, then other commands are executed
  later after all the subsystems are initialized.
- Changed BEGIN_CUSTOM_CVAR/END_CUSTOM_CVAR pair to CUSTOM_CVAR.
- Changed BEGIN_STAT/END_STAT pair to ADD_STAT.
- Changed BEGIN_COMMAND/END_COMMAND pair to CCMD.
- Added detection for Windows 2000, so the sound code will default to
  DirectSound under that OS instead of WinMM.

February 12, 2001
- Changed Die for missiles set as shootable so that they explode instead
  of doing a regular death.
- Changed MF2_FLOATBOB handling to not use health or special1. (So now
  it works with monsters.)
- Sorted the list of skins for a more user-friendly experience in the
  player setup menu and to make R_FindSkin() faster.
- Removed all traces of COM_Parse().
- Added support for ACS scripts that store p-codes and certain other values
  in bytes instead of dwords. This can offer considerable space savings.
  Also tweaked the interpreter to help keep the program counter and stack
  pointer in registers.

February 11, 2001
- Fixed: I_ShutdownMusic() should call S_StopMusic() so that the general
  sound code knows the song no longer exists. Having it free the song itself
  could crash if the game lost and regained focus while quitting.

February 8, 2001
- Added Anubis cheat.
- Really fixed rotated flats on sloped planes. The previous fix only affected
  floors at certain angles and did nothing for ceilings.

February 5, 2001
- Fixed: FPS meter with vid_fps was always 0.
- Fixed: Tilted floors/ceilings did not rotate properly.
- Fixed: Mirrors did not reflect slopes properly.
- Changed P_ProcessSwitchDef() so that not specifying a game name is the
  same as specifying "any".
- Fixed: Typo in zdoom.animdefs prevented SW1STRTN/SW2STRTN from switching.
- Fixed: -iwad did not work with wads that included a path.
- Tweaked P_TestActivateLine() so that only actual missiles will be promoted
  to activate player cross teleports.
- Did away with I_SetGUICapture(). It was too prone to error. Now the input
  code checks what kind of events it should generate each time I_StartTic()
  is called.
- Fixed: "Screenshot" mis-spelled as "screeshot" in controls menu.
- Fixed: The cursor in the option menus was one pixel too low.
- Fixed: Standard automap colors were all black if the game was started with
  am_overlay set to true.
- Fixed a typo in P_CheckKeys() that prevented the yellow skull and cards
  from being equivalent for 3-key doors. While I was at it, I rewrote the
  function, although it's still not what I would consider very readable. :-(
- Removed cheat-changing Dehacked support.
- I think I've got the problems with changing a thing's MF_SHADOW bit with
  Dehacked worked out now.

February 3, 2001
- Added "Alpha" and "Render Style" lines to Thing sections of dehacked
  patches.
- Fixed: Changing a thing's doomednum with dehacked would not update the
  DoomEdMap hash table, so it would have no effect.
- Fixed: Changing a thing's doomednum also changed its scale.
- Fixed: Modifying a hanging ceiling thing with dehacked would usually not
  reset the height to its Doom default. (Was using sizeof(OrgHeights)
  instead of NumOrgHeights.)
- Changed actor's translucency variable to alpha to reflect that it
  controls the alpha value for more than just translucency.
- Centralized column drawer selection to make adding more render styles
  in the future more convenient. The function is R_SetPatchStyle(). The
  selection of fg2rgb and bg2rgb has also been moved out of the various
  column drawers and into R_SetBlendFunc() so that they can be more
  generalized. What was a translucent column drawer is now blending without
  clamping, and what was an additive column drawer is now blending with
  clamping. Their names have been changed to reflect this.
- Changed WallMost()'s frac bits back to 30, but now it uses SafeDivScale.
  Now it should never crash there.
- Fixed: -playdemo did not like to use files in other directories.

February 1, 2001
- Fixed: Particles would not draw properly if a mirror was visible.
- Fixed: Viewing decals in mirrors could crash because PrepWall() only knew
  about non-mirrored surfaces when it clipped the lwall values.
- Changed the number of frac bits in WallMost() when clipping a line to 28
  instead of 30 to (better) avoid possible integer overflow.
- Fixed: Hub travel would hang when visiting a previously visited level.
- Got rid of linear.nas. It was only there to try and make things better for
  486s, and as I care even less about 486s now, there didn't seem to be much
  point in having it around wasting space in the executable.
- Removed RF_FORCECENTER renderflag and added a new RenderStyle actor member
  that's used to specify the render style instead of renderflags. Some
  styles are just aliases to other styles based on cvars (r_drawfuzz and
  transsouls), and others are styles that specify drawing. I also added a
  new style: STYLE_Add (additive blending) and made many of the DOOM
  projectiles that I had previously made translucent use it instead.

January 30, 2001
- Fixed xtoviewangle generation in R_InitTextureMapping(). (It was phase
  shifted 90 degrees)
- Removed R_ScaleFromGlobalAngle(), rw_distance, rw_angle1, and
  rw_normalangle.

January 27, 2001
- Fixed: Things made fuzzy with dehacked appeared no different when
  r_drawfuzz is false, because they also need to have their translucency set.
- Set the default for vid_bufferarea to 0, because large translucent areas
  suddenly coming into view (such as firing the BFG) can cause a very
  noticeable slowdown. I may take out the support for unbuffered output
  entirely.
- Fixed: Demons in nightmare mode would end up with 0 tic chase states.
- Fixed: A_BFGSpray() was using the player's autoaim setting for finding
  things to spray.

January 19, 2001
- Fixed some text prompts (e.g. "Do you want to quit?") so that they properly
  release the input code from GUI mode.
- Fixed ABossEye::Serialize() and DBrainState::Serialize().
- Extended Dehacked thing sound replacements so that you can use any sound
  defined in a SNDINFO lump.
- Fixed Dehacked thing sound replacements -- a 0 sound index means "no sound"
  and should not be treated as an offset into the sound list.
- Fixed translation table selection in R_ProjectSprite when using flags to
  specify a translation.
- Fixed HeadsOnAStick to be solid.

January 18, 2001
- Added some invisible bridge things.
- Fixed the sky around the tunnel in E1M1.
- Fixed P_DrawSplash2 not centering splashes around their point of origin.
- Fixed assignment of codepointers in [CODEPTR] sections of bex files.

December 24, 2000
- Added the firstvissprite and firstdrawseg variables so that I can restrict
  the vissprites and drawsegs drawn in skyboxes without changing their base
  pointers, which could move when they get realloced.

December 19, 2000
- Fixed Ceiling_LowerByValue acting like Ceiling_RaiseInstant.
- Fixed game grabbing the mouse during startup when the IWAD dialog
  is shown.
- Fixed dmflags not changing in gameplay menu.
- Fixed standard Doom colors not showing up on automap if the game was
  started with am_usecustomcolors 0.
- Fixed demons moving very slowly in nightmare mode.
- Fixed dehacked patches not setting bright frames properly.
- Fixed dehacked patches that change the player sprite's name.
- Fixed dehacked patches setting a thing's fuzzy property.
- Moved lots of supplementary dehacked data into zdoom.wad so that it's
  only in memory when it's needed.

December 18, 2000
- Fixed my sidedefs decompressor so that it works with maps that have
  unused sidedefs. As a consequence of this, the ordering of sidedefs in
  memory may be completely different from their ordering on disk.
- Fixed P_LoadSectors() to clamp each sector's light to the range [0,255]
  instead of ignoring the high byte stored in the wad.
- Fixed rendering of shaded decals when the light amp is on.
- Fixed the generation of the shading tables in R_InitTranslationTables() to
  not create values > 64.
- Gave spawnids to some things that were missing them.
- Reduced the default for vid_bufferarea to 6000.
- Reread the description of the SAL/SAR/SHL/SHR instructions. The OF
  flag is undefined for shifts other than 1--not unchanged. Rewrote
  the stretchers in blocks.nas to correct for this. On my Pentium II,
  the OF flag is left unchanged, so I got the desired result, but
  other processors can change it. :-(
- Added back triple buffering, because double buffering can be
  (but is not always) significantly slower.
- Fixed up the sound code for the new FMOD 3.3 API.

December 15, 2000
- Fixed fourth and fifth episodes not appearing in the menu for the
  extended Heretic IWAD.
- Reorganized DCajunMaster::WhatToGet() so that Reachable() is called
  less often.
- Fixed multikill messages appearing for everyone and not just whoever
  got it.
- Divided thinkers into thinking and non-thinking classes. By default,
  a FThinkerIterator will not iterate through non-thinking classes.
  Those must be specified explicitly. Made the decals non-thinking so
  the think code doesn't waste any time on them.
- Fixed bots not being able to spawn in deathmatch mode if there are
  not enough coop starts.
- Added support for compressed SIDEDEFS lumps.
- Made the splash bases MF_NOGRAVITY so that they stay at the surface
  of BOOM deep water instead of sinking into it.
- Made splashes work as expected in sectors with the BOOM deep water
  effect (and set as a water zone).
- Fixed positioning of weapon sprite. (Was one pixel too high.)
- Fixed vertical aiming on railgun being swapped.
- Fixed SUBCLASS_NS macro in a_doomdecorations.cpp. It was using radius
  as the height.

December 14, 2000
- Fixed lines not being considered for rendering when at least one side
  is sloped but the heights on each side of the line are identical at
  both ends.
- Fixed physics and rendering of non-horizontal slopes. They were both
  messed up because I had been subtracting b*y in the ZatPoint
  calculations when I should have added it. Clipping the right edge of
  non-horizontal slopes to the screen was also wrong because I was
  subtracting from x instead of y for the y component of the point
  intersecting the screen.
- Fixed automap being all black when am_usecustomcolors is false.
- Updated Heretic status bar for unbuffered output.
- Stopped creating the primary surface as a complex flipping surface so
  that I can set colors 0 and 255 under NT.
- Made the video code better able to cope with different surface lost
  conditions.
- Fixed alt-tab killing the program by listening to WM_ACTIVATEAPP and
  forcing buffering (that never gets flushed to the screen) when the app
  goes inactive.
- Moved the palette change to occur immediately after the page blit.
- Fixed GUI capture being lost when the demo cycle returns to the title 
  screen and the menu is active.
- Fixed being able to get stuck in the edges of sloped ceilings. In
  PIT_CheckLine(), I was using the actor's current position instead of its
  desired position to calculate the nearest point on the line.
- Fixed skyboxes so that sprites seen through multiple visplanes are visible
  in all the visplanes and not just the first one.
- Made a bunch of changes to slope walking to try to make walking along the
  very edge of a slope work better. This included adding a floorsector field
  to AActor that records the sector that the floorz field came from.
- Changed the nearest point on line calculation in PIT_CheckLine() to use
  floats, because ints aren't large enough for the intermediate calculations.
- Changed S_StopSoundID() to not stop sounds with the same priority.
- Fixed normal mace balls so that they fall down after some distance.
  Apparently, in Heretic MF2_LOGRAV has precedence over MF_NOGRAVITY.
- Fixed sky boxes so they are not lit by extralight.

December 13, 2000
- Fixed image collections not remapping any instances of color 0 in a patch
  to a different color. This was most evident in the multiplayer status bar
  where the background could be seen through the player's eyes and eyebrows.
- Made normal skies work with animations found in an ANIMDEFS lump.
- Made screen melts work by forcing them to use buffered output.
- Reimplemented screenshot command.
- Changed DCanvas::Dim() to read and write four pixels at a time so that
  the first frame dimmed before buffering is forced only takes about 1/4th
  the time to draw as it would if single pixels were read and written.
- Made shaded and fuzzy decals count toward transparent area.
- Fixed not being able to pick up a Megasphere if your armor is already full.
- Fixed Dehacked patches not being able to clear a frame's fullbright
  property.

December 12, 2000
- Renamed zdoom.cfg to zdoom.ini so that old versions can coexist in the
  same directory as this one with less hassle.
- Reimplemented decals.
- Changed the player setup menu to use number instead of named teams.
- Fixed stack overflow caused by floating point imprecision when setting
  turbo out of range.
- Fixed DGlow not working properly because lightlevels are now unsigned.
- Fixed the second DScroller constructor not setting m_vdx and m_vdy.
- Changed R_SetDefaultColormap() to look in the colormaps namespace before
  looking in the global namespace.
- Fixed fade MAPINFO command not working.
- Fixed picking up the green armor showing the generic pickup message.
- Fixed massacre cheat to not let pain elementals spew out lost souls upon
  their death. This also fixes massacre from crashing if the dead lost soul
  was patched to actually stick around in a map.
- Separated AGibs into ARealGibs and AGibs. ARealGibs is what gets spawned
  automatically when something gets crushed. AGibs is what gets spawned when
  gibs are explicitly placed on a map.
- Fixed C_BackupCVars() recording the specific value of a cvar instead of
  making a copy of that value.

December 11, 2000
- Fixed generic ceilings with texture/type changes from using model floor
  sectors instead of model ceiling sectors if they had type raise to highest
  ceiling or type lower to highest ceiling.
- Fixed elevators.

December 9, 2000
- Made old Doom level translation programmable through the use of simple
  precompiled scripts that the game loads from a wad.

December 6, 2000
- Restored Doom's original 50-element fuzzoffset table and rewrote the
  fuzz drawers to accomodate it while still using as few branches as I
  thought reasonable.

December 5, 2000
- Got the display mostly up and running again without PTC. The new design
  allows for automatic switching between buffered and unbuffered modes
  based on how many transparent pixels were visible in the previous frame,
  similar to Build. Unlike Build, the cutoff is always a specific amount
  of pixels (cvar-controlled) instead of one-eighth the total area of the
  screen.

November 28, 2000
- Removed the use of PTC and returned to my rudimentary DirectDraw support.
- Got rid of all the funky multiple palette handling stuff in v_palette.cpp.
  Paletted textures haven't been realized yet, and if they ever are, the way
  I had things set up probably isn't the way to utilize them.

November 25, 2000
- Fixed BossTargets automatically destroying themselves.
- Got rid of the global brain state and moved it into a thinker that gets
  spawned if any BrainEyes are present on the level.
- Made PIT_RadiusAttack() calculate damage based on distance from the
  thing's bounding cylinder instead of its center point.
- Made thinkers use Exec-style lists because of their simple insertion and
  deletion code.
- Made R_TextureNumForName() return 1 instead of 0 for missing textures so
  levels that lack textures are easier to navigate.
- Changed ADecal's doomednum to 9200 to deconflict with Hexen coop start 5.
- Created an MMX version of the color picker routine. Building a fade table
  with it is about 15% faster than with the straight C version. Not exactly
  a stunning speed increase, but on slower machines, the speedup should at
  least be slightly noticable.

November 24, 2000
- #ifdef'ed out most of the FColorMatcher class. Too many colors are
  visibly off when building fog with it. :-(
- Simplified the calculations in DoBlending() and created an MMX version.

November 20, 2000
- Implemented Scroll_Floor and Scroll_Ceiling specials for ACS scripts.
- Fixed drawing of masked midtextures that are used as special effects (i.e.
  invisible platforms).
- Updated R_AddLine() to only treat as solid two-sided lines if the upper or
  lower tier (whichever is appropriate) actually has a texture.
- Made doors close to the current floor height instead of whatever the floor
  was at when the door started lowering.
- Rearranged P_DoCrunch() somewhat so that non-shootable things do not block
  moving floors/ceilings. (Same behavior as Doom.)
- Fixed model sector changes in EV_DoFloor() and EV_DoCeiling().
- Added mdk command to kill whatever the player is aiming at.
- Added the BOOM fix to getNextSector() so that lines that have the same
  sector on both sides and are also part of the sector will not return
  that sector.
- Fixed PathFollower not initializing PrevNode and CurrNode when it is
  spawned.

November 18, 2000
- Added per-sidedef lighting control. Also added two new mapinfo fields
  (vertwallshade and horizwallshade) to control the relative light of
  vertical/horizontal walls with the sectors. Evenlighting is now obsolete.

November 17, 2000
- Added a new thing (SectorSilencer) to prevent actors from making noise in
  specific sectors, in case anybody wants to use noisy actors in their
  sky boxes.
- Fixed skyboxes to draw all visplanes with a skybox and not just the first
  one.
- Added tilted floor physics. Actors can walk around on floors with slopes
  as large as 45 degrees. For anything steeper than that, they slide down.
  Monsters will treat steep floors like drop offs and avoid getting on them.

November 16, 2000
- Added a bForceSlide parameter to P_XYMovement() to force actors to slide
  against walls when blocked, even if they don't specify MF2_SLIDE. This
  allows for better operation of conveyor belts with corners.
- Fixed volcano sounds in Heretic.
- Revised carrying sectors again. Removed sc_carry_players. Each thing
  checks the sectors it is standing on to see if they have any carry
  properties. If they do, it adds those values to its momx and momy.
  Thinkers are still used to set the carry properties, which are reset
  to 0 at the beginning of each tic. In order to make sure all carry
  properties have been set before any actors think, I introduced the
  concept of statnums for DThinkers ala Build. DScrollers have lower statnums
  than actors, so they all get executed before actors.
  All carriers for a single sector are cumulative. If an actor is straddling
  multiple sectors with carry properties, then those properties are averaged.
  (X and Y components are averaged separately.) This should give the best
  compromise between BOOM carry behavior and realistic behavior at sector
  boundaries.

November 15, 2000
- Made A_WaterfallSound() and A_WindSound() play looped sounds.
- Fixed spelling error in SNDINFO: Heretic's waterfall sound is
  waterfl, not watrfl.
- Changed P_ActivateLine() to call P_TestActivateLine() and changed
  P_TestActivateLine() to allow missiles to activate regular teleporters.
  This is neccessary for the Mace's Death Ball.
- Took the momz and tics setting out of P_SpawnPuff(). It is the
  responsibility of the spawned puff to set these things as desired. I had
  meant to do it a long time ago but forgot all about it.
- Changed deferred scripts to remember the player who triggered them.

November 14, 2000
- Removed the code for F*CVar::GetRealType() from c_cvars.h and moved it
  into c_cvars.cpp. Virtual inline functions are not inlined and cause the
  function to be generated for every source file the class is used in.
- Fixed bug with Transfer_CeilingLight special. I was or'ing CeilingLight
  with SECF_ABSLIGHTING instead of CeilingFlags.

November 11, 2000
- Slopes don't work in mirrors. :-(
- Removed the viewangletox table and rewrote R_InitTextureMapping() to
  generate xtoviewangle without it.
- Added support for per-skybox control of visibility.

November 10, 2000
- Implemented sky boxes. Total time: ~40 minutes. :-) Should probably test
  it some more, though.

November 9, 2000
- Fixed a sprite clipping bug at the right edge of mirrors.

November 8, 2000
- Reimplemented mirrors.
- Improved positioning of masked mid textures.

November 7, 2000
- Increased the fractional precision of swall calculations.
- Removed all references to Doom's light tables.

November 6, 2000
- Moved the lighting calculation out of the main loop in R_MapTiltedPlane()
  (and its assembly equivalent) into a separate function, since it can now
  be linearly interpolated. This does away with the use of CMOVs in the
  assembly code, so now I won't need to write a non-CMOV version of it. It's
  also somewhat faster, especially in the non-assembly version.

November 3, 2000
- Tweaked the brown color range for console fonts to actually look brown.
- Generalized FFont::BuildTranslations() some so it's not so big. Did the
  same for the FConsoleFont version.

November 1, 2000
- Got the tilted plane lighting working without the LUT in 320x200. Also
  removed the divide from the nontilted version.

October 31, 2000
- Got the plane light calculation without using zlight to match the light
  when using zlight (aside from the finer gradiation). Woohoo! Now to get
  rid of the divide...
- Fixed creation of large (>64k) blockmaps. Also replaced the Boom version
  of P_CreateBlockMap() with the MBF version.

October 17, 2000
- Tried to remove the use of the zlight lookup for plane mapping, but I'm
  having a hard time actually duplicating its results. (Nevermind that I
  should be able to derive the properly formula without difficulty...)
- Noticed distant sprites were way too jumpy. At first, I thought it was
  because I was only using 8 bits of precision, so I temporarily upped it
  back to 16 bits, and the problem persisted. It was caused by calculating
  1/z in R_ProjectSprite() (as a fixed 16.16) and multiplying by that.
  Dividing by z instead fixed the problem.

October 16, 2000
- I think I have all the sector movers set to properly handle tilty areas.
- Set P_SpawnDoorCloseIn30() and P_SpawnDoorRaiseIn5Mins() to set the
  thinker's m_BotDist.
- Upped the fractional bits of precision for view space coordinates to 12.
  This drops the upper FOV limit to ~172.8.

October 10, 2000
- Fixed pillar floors using the ceiling plane for calculations.
- Changed P_Thing_Spawn() and P_Thing_Projectile() to only set MF_DROPPED
  for special things, so spawned monsters can be crushed to gibs.
- Added carrymomx, carrymomy, and carrycount members to AActor. DScroller
  now effects these rather than momx and momy. Slow scrollers work now,
  and there's no possibility of drift caused by friction.
- Changed earthquake behavior to match Hexen's.

October 9, 2000
- Added Unreal teleport zoom effect controlled by the telezoom cvar.
- Reduced the renderer's precision along the (x,y) plane in view space to
  8 bits of fractional precision in order to accomodate large FOVs.

October 7, 2000
- Fixed lighting to not vary with different FOVs.
- Changed the initialization of finetangent to not phase shift the table,
  as I did previously for finesine.

October 6, 2000
- Added support for panning, scaling, and rotating of tilted flats.

October 5, 2000
- Added FloorLight and CeilingLight members to sector_t. Changed
  Transfer_FloorLight and Transfer_CeilingLight to use a thinker to copy
  light levels over to these fields.
- Fixed serialization of sectors: The ceiling's xoffs was stored twice
  instead of storing both xoffs and yoffs.

October 4, 2000
- Added back the "too far off side?" check to R_ProjectSprite(), since
  sprites are now projected into a view space with a constant 90 degree FOV.
  Also added a test for sprites above/below the screen. This test is
  different from Lee Killough's test in Boom, which I never managed to get
  working right with freelook (not that I tried very hard, either...).

October 2, 2000
- Added an optimization to R_AddLine(): 2-sided lines that cannot be seen
  past because their openings are off-screen will be marked as solid.
- Changed the pointers in drawseg_t to ptrdiff_t so the "fun" stuff in
  R_StoreWallRange for expanding the openings array and adjusting
  pointers is unnecessary.
- Did the changes I talked about on September 23, except the calculations
  are still associated with R_StoreWallRange() so they don't need to be
  performed if the wall is entirely clipped (but they only get done once
  per wall, no matter how many ranges it gets clipped to).

September 27, 2000
- Moved wall texture calculation (i.e. prepwall) back to floats, just to be
  safe as far as integer overflow goes.

September 26, 2000
- All right, I've caved in. I'm now using some Build code. Build already does
  everything necessary for good quality rendering, and it seems a shame to
  needlessly duplicate all of Ken's work.

September 23, 2000
- After trying to get slopes to look nicer, I have come to the following sad
  conclusion. Clipping walls into pieces and then doing all the drawing
  calculations in R_StoreWallRange() is not the way to go when you have
  slopes, since all fractional precision is lost at the edges of the
  drawsegs, making an accurate calculation of (x,y) for slope calculations
  impossible. So my plan for now is: Move most of the functionality of
  R_StoreWallRange() into R_AddLine(), and leave R_StoreWallRange() around as
  a function that just creates drawsegs and calls the texture mapping
  routines.
- Made solidsegs a fixed-size array that is big enough. (It was not actually
  growing before, so it might as well have been fixed!)

September 21, 2000
- Fixed C_WriteCVars() so that it doesn't delete the strings it gets
  using GetGenericRep().
- Reduced the FOV range to [5,175] to combat integer overflow with extreme
  values.
- Removed excess precision from texturecolumn calculations in BlastColumn,
  since it was overflowing occasionally.

September 20, 2000
- Removed the offset field from r_segs, as it is no longer necessary. (Walls
  are now mapped based on their linedefs, not their individual segs.)
- Bumped the wall mapper down to only 4 bits of fractional precision. The
  results look just as good as floats, and don't overflow so easily--a wall
  15296 units long didn't overflow. (I didn't check any longer, since walls
  that long are highly unlikely to occur in any Doom map, because the
  original Doom engine would render them with horrible jitter.)

  In the process, I decided to go the Build route and give walls a texture
  width (the number of texels that fit across the wall). When arbitrarily
  moveable walls are implemented, I think it will be more useful to maintain
  a constant spread of texels across a wall than to maintain a constant
  texel width. Without moveable walls, this approach just makes diagonal
  walls align nicer.

September 19, 2000
- Swapped the meanings of the m and n vectors for the wall texture mapper
  and got the correct vectors to use. Unfortunately, under most
  circumstances, they generate values too big for 16.16 fixed point.

September 18, 2000
- Changed R_RenderBSPNode() to check against the bbox for front nodes as
  well as back. Must remember to be on the lookout for drawing errors this
  might cause, since the old R_CheckBBox() was too inaccurate for this.
- Tried to change wall texture mapping to use the same "magic" vectors that
  I use for tilted planes, but I don't trust the vectors I derived: The
  u/z vector depended on (x,y), but v/z depended only on x, just the opposite
  of what it should be.
- About the adjacent wall problem, that was caused by a subsector with a
  single seg viewed almost head-on. Changing R_CheckBBox() to use the same
  transforms as R_AddLine() fixed the problem.
- Fixed some bad cases for my clipping code in R_AddLine(). Although I had
  already used it in my prototype engine with several Build maps, I found
  problems in Doom2 MAP02 that needed fixing.

September 16, 2000
- Changed wall projection in r_bsp.cpp to use more standard 1/z perspective
  projections instead of polar coordinates and got the desired result: no
  more excessively jiggly walls. Now I need to do it with the wall texture
  mapper, so that wall textures don't jiggle either. One minor problem:
  Adjacent walls can sometimes be one pixel apart. (Why?)

September 13, 2000
- Added the 181 special to slope floors/ceilings at two-sided walls.
- Fixed sporadic rendering problems with masked mid textures caused by
  not ensuring sprflipvert was false.
- Added "world" as a valid ambient sound type, for consistancy with the
  other types. Ambient sounds without a type specified still default to
  world.
- Change P_AimLineAttack() to return a pitch instead of slope. It also
  returns the actor's pitch instead of 0, if nothing to aim at was found.
  Also changed it to be responsible for limiting the player's autoaim,
  since this is a more logical place than in the routines that call it.
  This simplified P_SpawnPlayerMissile() and P_BulletSlope().

September 12, 2000
- Created a generic Trace() function.

September 11, 2000
- Finished the assembly plane drawer. Or, rather, the Pentium Pro and higher
  version, since it uses CMOV instructions.
- Things to do:
    Create a Pentium version of the plane drawer.
    Create a trace function that knows about planes and replace all the
	 redundant code in the different traversal iterators.
	Fix the bots so they understand planes.
	Fix movement code so that planes are treated as planes and not as a
	 bunch of discrete steps.

September 9, 2000
- Started work on the assembly plane drawer. It's your standard subdividing
  affine mapper using the overlapped FDIV trick, but with Doom-style lighting.
  It's about four times faster than the previous C version, and at high enough
  resolutions, it's even faster than the wall drawer. But it's not complete:
  It doesn't draw incomplete subspans at the end of a span.

September 6, 2000
- Made some optimizations to the plane renderer. It now runs nearly 13 times
  faster than before (in the debug build). Adding some inline assembly to
  R_MapTiltedPlane() to convert floats to ints (instead of using (int) to
  cast it) sped it up to 20% of its original time. Most of the rest was
  achieved through the standard technique of splitting it up into spans and
  using affine mapping for those spans. Interestingly, in the debug build,
  the span-based approach is only about half the speed of the "perfect"
  implementation and no faster. ("Perfect" is in quotes because there is
  some error built up by using deltas between pixels instead of calculating
  1/z, u/z, and v/z anew each pixel, so it's not really perfect, but it is
  very close.) Hopefully converting this to assembly will give another good
  speed up.

September 5, 2000
- Finished preliminary renderer for planes. They draw properly, but very
  slowly. (With one divide, seven multiplies, and three compiler-generated
  calls to ftol per pixel, that's to be expected.)

September 4, 2000
- Continued work on planes.

September 2, 2000
- Moved R_DoorClosed() into R_AddLine() so it can use the already-calculated
  ceiling/floor heights without making them global variables.

September 1, 2000
- Continued work on planes.
 -Removed tsilheight and bsilheight from drawseg_t, since they're not
  particularly useful when the floor or ceiling isn't at a constant height.

August 30, 2000
- Continued work on planes.

August 29, 2000
- Started work on adding real floor/ceiling planes. (And I do mean planes,
  not just slopes.)

August 28, 2000
- Removed the "too far off the side?" check from R_ProjectSprite(). The fix
  for wide FOVs made sprites disappear when they weren't very far away.
- Started work on extended skins by writing the spec notes in skins.cpp.

August 24, 2000
- Fixed memory corruption when trying to add more coop bots than there are
  enough single player starts for: DoAddBot needs to check for the start,
  not PlayerThink. Otherwise, when DoAddBot calls G_DoReborn, it thinks
  the player is -1, because it gets the player number from the player start
  for the index passed instead of using the index itself.
- Tried to prevent drawing areas behind mirrors through a mirror. If no
  segs cross the line defined by the mirror, no walls will be drawn
  through the mirror. However, things can still show up through the mirror.
  Another issue is that gaps can be seen through the junction of two
  adjoining mirrors. I can live with this; A mirror with restrictions is still
  better than no mirror at all, right?
- Added proper view positioning for mirrors at any angle.

August 23, 2000
- Made mirrors actually flip the view. I still need to handle mirroring
  around arbitrary mirrors instead of just horizontal/vertical ones.

August 21, 2000
- Started working on mirrors by adding semi-portals.
- Simplified P_InitAnimDefs() by getting rid of the explicit state machine
  and using a separate function to parse flat and texture animations.
- Fixed sprite clipping for high FOVs.
- Changed R_DrawPlanes() to calculate texture coordinates relative to the
  middle of the screen instead of the left edge of the screen. Thanks to
  this change, I was able to remove the distscale variable, as it is no
  longer needed. Flats now line up with walls as perfectly as they're going
  to get, given the jiggly nature of wall rendering.

August 19, 2000
- Added support for animating switches and extended the ANIMDEFS lump to
  support defining them. Converted the ANIMATED lump in zdoom.wad to an
  ANIMDEFS lump, and changed the code to support multiple ANIMDEFS lumps.

August 15, 2000
- Added more consistant sorting for sprites in the same (x,y) location: In
  the event of a tie, the sprites' tops are used for sorting. If that is
  insufficient, the sort order is undefined, as before.
- Removed all references to CALC_TABLES. The game will always generate the
  tables on startup now.
- Changed finecosine to a class with a single inline operator[] member.
  Now cosine lookups are just as fast as sine lookups, because it's not
  necessary to dereference a pointer.
- Changed ylookup, columnofs, r_dsclipbot, r_dscliptop, floorclip,
  walltop, wallbottom, negonearray, screenheightarray, xtoviewangle,
  ceilingclip, yslope, and spanend back into fixed-size arrays. Their
  maximum possible values aren't *that* big, and the compiler can generate
  more efficient code when it always knows where the array will be.
- Another optimization: The renderer no longer draws underneath the console.
- Thanks to the span renderer's improved accuracy, I have been able to do
  some optimizations to bring R_MapPlane() down to five multiplies per span.
  This is better than the previous eight and also better than the original
  Doom's worst case of six multiplies per span. Doom also used a cache that
  could give it a best case of just three multiplies per span, but I'm not
  sure doing so is really worthwhile.

  As an added bonus, visplanes with the same orientation will line up with
  each other no matter where they are on screen. Now I just need to fix the
  wall jittering... (That may be too much to ask from the Doom engine.)
  
  As part of the optimizations, I:
  - Removed the distscale array and replaced it with a single value.
  - Renamed spanstart to spanend to reflect the fact that it now holds the
    right edges of spans instead of their left edges. Also changed it to an
    array of shorts.
  - Made R_DrawPlanes() responsible for maintaining the texture coordinates.
    Now all R_MapPlane() has to do is scale and pan them.
  - Removed most of my comments from R_DrawPlanes(), since the texture
    coordinates are no longer calculated in a single location.

August 14, 2000
- Added code in w_wad.cpp to limit the number of open wads to some preset
  amount instead of keeping all the wads open at a time, in case the user
  has more wads s/he wants to use than there are file handles available.
- Figured out the crash from the other day: Decals were only being cached
  if their sizes were unknown; they were not recached if they had been
  flushed.

August 12, 2000
- Added bullet holes. It crashed once in testing when I was foolishly
  running fullscreen, so now I am trying to replicate the problem. The
  error occured in WallSpriteColumn() where it called drawfunc() and was
  an access violation.
- Implemented RF_FULLBRIGHT for wall sprites.
- Moved most virtual function bodies that were in header files out of the
  headers so that the compiler wouldn't generate code for them for every
  derived class that didn't supply their own versions.
- Added FDecalLib and supporting classes.

August 10, 2000
- Removed the MF3_CARRIED flag and replaced it with the carrysec member. The
  intent of MF3_CARRIED was to prevent neighboring sectors from having an
  accelerative effect on actors (an undesirable effect in at least one of
  Heretic's maps), but it also prevented multiple carriers in a single sector
  from having a cumulative effect on the player.
- Optimized R_DrawSprite() to initialize the sprite clipping arrays to their
  largest possible range instead of initializing them to a special "not
  clipped" value. This saves the time needed to set "not clipped" columns
  to valid values later. It also saves the trouble of making any passes for
  clipping sprites in fake floor/ceiling sectors. Also redid the clipping
  loops so that VC++ produces more optimal code for them.
- Fixed R_InitTables() to produce an accurate sine table instead of a sine
  table that was slightly off. Also implemented the optimization suggestion
  that was in the code.
- Moved the << 10 scaling out of R_MapPlane() and into the calculation of
  xscale and yscale in R_DrawPlanes() with the intent to speed up plane
  mapping slightly. As a bonus, adjacent visplanes with the same texture
  now match up far better than before, so it was worth it even if it didn't
  give a huge speedup.

August 8, 2000
- Changed FHelperThread() to use MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() instead of
  MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx(), because the latter is not available under
  Windows 95. I also had to change FCDThread to not use QueueUserAPC() to
  handle play finished notifications, since MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() is
  not an alertable function. Fortunately, the reason I used an APC in the
  first place no longer applies, because the CD_WndProc will always be
  called from the helper thread's context, since the window is now being
  created in the thread's context. (See my July 14 log; I don't know why
  it even worked under 98.)
- Fixed FHelperThread() to call Init() from within the context of the newly-
  created thread, as it should.
- Eliminated BestColor() from the game and replaced its use with
  ColorMatcher. Then I found a bug in R_BuildPlayerTranslation(): RGB values
  were not clipped to the range [0,255]. 

August 7, 2000
- Wrote the FColorMatcher class to do color matching much quicker than
  BestColor() with nearly the same quality.

August 5, 2000
- Changed the command parser in c_dispatch.cpp to something simpler, but
  which also allows for using \" inside quoted strings.

August 2, 2000
- Implemented RF_ALPHASHADED for wall sprites.

August 1, 2000
- Implemented RF_REL* flags. They use the texture pegging flags of the linedef
  to keep them in line with the underlying textures if the sector height
  changes.

July 29, 2000
- Implemented RF_CLIPUPPER and RF_CLIPLOWER. RF_CLIPFULL also works for
  one-sided lines, since that was the first case I did when I added the
  bound wall sprites.
- Added vertical flipping for wall sprites.

July 28, 2000
- Made fullbright a separate field in FState instead of merging it with
  the frame index.

July 27, 2000
- Added these fields to AActor: renderflags, picnum, and alphacolor, although
  they still need to actually be implemented. Also changed the sizes of the
  sprite and frame fields.
- Started work on wall sprites bound to walls (i.e. decals). Right now, it
  can clip the sprite to one-sided walls.
- Fixed hotkeys not selecting appropriate item(s) in the menus.

July 22, 2000
- Fixed console drawing extra lines above the top of the screen.
- Added IWADPaths section to the config file to indicate a default set of
  directories to search for IWADs.
- Added screenshot_quiet cvar to prevent the screenshot command from
  displaying any messages when a screenshot is captured.
- Added wait and unset console commands.
- Changed C_DoKey() to execute a copy of the command bound to a key instead
  of the original, because the key might rebind itself and mess up the
  parser if the original command is executed.

July 21, 2000
- Changed FindSprite() in d_dehacked.cpp to use DWORDs for comparisons.
- Added Thing_Move and ThrustThingZ specials from Skull Tag. Also added
  Skull Tag's newtid parameter to Thing_Spawn(NoFog).
- Changed blocked pillars to stay in one place until not blocked, because
  they had stopped doing that, probably because of something I did for
  stacked things on moving sectors.

July 20, 2000
- Removed the use of memmoves in R_ClipWallSegment(). VC++ generates more
  optimal code using for loops, because memmove generated a function call.
- Fixed R_DrawVisSprite() not always drawing the full width of a sprite when
  using r_columnmethod 1.
- Added x and y thing scaling factors. Range is 0-255, and 63 is the default.
  Actual scale is (scale+1)/64.
- Changed R_DrawSprite() to clip sprites against drawsegs based on depth
  and not vertical scale. Also added an extra parameter to
  R_ScaleFromGlobalAngle() that receives the depth of the passed angle.
- Fixed Heretic's bloody skull transitioning to one of the player's states.
- Removed MF3_SKINNED flag and added a skin field for every actor.
- Made -host 1 not start a multiplayer game without starting the network,
  because I currently have no TCP/IP stack installed on my computer.
- Fixed players being able to gib infinitely under a crusher.
- Changed crushing ceilings to behave more like Doom again: Things that were
  on the floor stay on the floor, and things above the floor get pushed into
  it.
- Fixed "jiggly" sprites where each columns' textures were not aligned
  properly. Also fixed a bug in rt_map4cols_asm1() and rt_map4cols_asm2()
  that was less obvious with the jiggly sprites: The right 2 pixels of
  odd-length runs were swapped.
- Fixed bug in R_DrawColumnHorizP_C(): Mapped one pixel too many.
- Condensed R_ClipSolidWallSegment() and R_ClipPassWallSegment() into
  R_ClipWallSegment(), since they were nearly identical.

July 19, 2000
- Fixed WritePCXfile(). I was writing two extra header bytes.
- Added assembly versions of the scaling masked block drawers and made them
  support clipping the block to the screen.

July 17, 2000
- Added assembly versions of the non-scaling masked block drawers and made
  them support clipping the block to the screen.

July 15, 2000
- Slightly optimized parallax sky drawing.
- Changed the controls menu to only grab the mouse when it's waiting for a
  key to bind to an action.
- Changed the DirectInput keyboard reader in i_input.cpp to read the entire
  keyboard state and generate events based on the differences between that
  state and the previous one. Reading key transitions with GetDeviceData()
  was more efficient (I assume), but it was too easy for NT to miss
  transitions if CPU time got tight.
- Added an absolute parameter to I_SetGUICapture to force the setting of
  GUI capturing to a specific setting instead of adjusting a counter. This
  is necessary for proper recovery when catching a recoverable error, and
  GUI capturing was already enabled.
- Finished CD code (at least I hope I did). Under NT, it can even loop a
  track without bringing the game to a halt. (Yay!) Unfortunately, that
  seems unavoidable under 9x. Oh well.

July 14, 2000
- Under NT, APC calls do not seem to work when there is an outstanding MCI
  notification. Now FHelperThread uses an event to signal the thread to quit.
- Here's a mean difference between NT and 98 (as far as I can tell): Under
  98, each thread has its own message queue. Under NT, each thread shares
  a single queue for the entire process. Now I use an APC call to restart
  playback, because I don't know what context the WndProc is runnning in.
  (I could check the OS version and work accordingly, but then I'd have two
  methods to do the same thing, and I have no guarantee Microsoft won't
  change things in a future version of Windows.)
- Changed autoexec handling so now you can run any number console scripts
  automatically.
- Added a new config file format that can store information for multiple
  games (i.e. Doom, Heretic, and Hexen) and keep the appropriate settings
  separate. This is your basic ini-style file, rather than a list of
  console commands.

July 11, 2000
- Removed an I_PauseMouse() call from Win32Video::SetMode() that was
  preventing the game from grabbing the mouse in windowed mode at startup.
  (Why was that in there?)
- Implemented localized ACS strings in the game. It's even smart enough to
  detect when the user changes the regional settings!

July 8, 2000
- Created enhanced ACS format (ACSE) and used it to add string localization
  support to the language.
- Added InterpolationSpecial (#9075) whose special is activated whenever
  a PathFollower reaches an InterpolationPoint with the same special.
- Fixed stack overflows when all the patrol points in a path are so close
  together that a monster can touch them all at once, by setting
  MF_JUSTATTACKED when the monster reaches one point to force it to move
  when SetState() is called instead of cycling to the next point.
- Renamed AWayPoint to APatrolPaint.

July 5, 2000
- Moved the StatusBar->Tick() call inside P_Ticker() so that the status bar
  doesn't tick when the game is paused.
- Reworked the string-building p-codes in p_acs.cpp so that the string gets
  built as each p-code is encountered instead of waiting until the end p-code.
  This is safe because a properly-generated script will never enter a wait
  state between the begin and end p-codes (which I initially thought it
  might).
- Changed the meaning of some HUD message X coordinates:
	[ 0.0, 1.0]: Position between left and right edge valid box locations
	[-1.0, 0.0): Position between left and right edge of screen
	( 1.0, 2.0]: Same as [0.0,1.0], but center each line inside box
	[-2.0, 1.0): Same as [-1.0,0.0), but center each line inside box
- Added FHUDMessageTypeOnFadeOut class.
- Added an id for use with Attach/DetachMessage(). The status bar can now
  keep track of HUD messages for you and automatically deletes an old version
  of a message when a newer one is attached. An id of 0 means not to track
  the message.
- Added the hudmessage ACS command.
- Tried improving the accuracy of span drawing by increasing precision (i.e.
  a>>6 is better than (a>>16)<<10), but it didn't seem to do any good. Still,
  as a remnant of that there is now a function FixedMulDiv(a,b,c) that
  calculates the fixed point result of a*b/c. Even if it's not much more
  precise than FixedDiv(FixedMul(a,b),c), it's at least marginally faster,
  since it does no shifts.
- Changed APathFollower::Activate() to reposition itself to the first node so
  that it doesn't briefly appear at its old location when activated.
- Changed AInterpolationPoint::PostBeginPlay() to FormChain(). Now it's called
  whenever something that uses the path wants to get on the path. Thus, we can
  be sure that the path is actually completed when the thing wants to get on
  it (at level start), which it wouldn't be if the thing was placed on the map
  before all the points of the path.
- Simplified AInterpolationPoint::ScanForLoop().

July 4, 2000
- Added sector actions for players landing on floor, hitting ceiling, entering
  a sector, leaving a sector, hitting use inside a sector, or hitting use on
  a sector's wall. The way this is exposed to level designers is the same as
  Skull Tag's 9999 thing (action taken whenever the player is on the floor),
  but is more flexible because it supports multiple activation types and you
  can have multiple actions in a single sector.

July 3, 2000
- Added an effect for respawn protection.
- Added dmflags2 cvar, and consolidated weapondrop and nobfgaim into it. Also
  implemented Skull Tag's respawn protection and barrel respawning into it.
- Added the FFlagCVar class. This just maps onto a FIntCVar (i.e. dmflags)
  and allows a more meaningful way for the user to manipulate it than by
  changing bit values directly.

June 27, 2000
- Removed the restriction in ChangeCamera that it can only change the
  player's view to SecurityCameras. Now the proper way to activate a
  moving camera is to use both ChangeCamera and Thing_Activate. ChangeCamera
  sets the player's view to the camera, and Thing_Activate gets it moving.
- Changed the automap so that changes to the am_*color cvars take effect
  immediately instead of the next time the automap is toggled.

June 26, 2000
- Got rid of cvar_t and switched to a subclassable FBaseCVar class. Now the
  game actively recognizes different cvar types.

June 14, 2000
- The -iwad parameter can now specify a directory, as in BOOM.
- Changed -warp parameter so that using -warp x with ExMx games will use
  episode 1, map x instead of episode x, map unknown.
- Added a dialog box to select the IWAD to use if the game finds more than
  one.
- Switched the compression library from mini-LZO to zlib. Zlib gives better
  compression, but still seems pretty fast (hard to judge on a P2-350 :-).
  More importantly, zlib is not GPL (it has a BSD-style license) and I can't
  have something so relatively minor as a compression library trying to attach
  its license terms to the included Heretic and Hexen source, which are not
  GPL.

June 10, 2000
- Modified FindLevelByNum() to check that a map exists before returning a
  level with that number, because I have Doom 1 and 2 using the same levelnums
  for different maps.

June 7, 2000
- Added MF3_SKINNED flag to prevent sprite changing when calling SetState().
- Added fallingdamage and nofallingdamage MAPINFO flags.
- Added support for RIFF CDDA files.
- Added support for CD tracks as music. The cdtrack and cdid MAPINFO keys can
  be used to select it for a specific map.

June 6, 2000
- Added the CVAR_NOINITCALL flag to allow for cvars with callbacks that
  aren't called automatically during initialization.

June 5, 2000
- Moved all the CD-related MCI calls into a separate thread in an attempt to
  avoid pauses when looping a CD track. A ring buffer is used to send
  commands from the main thread to the helper thread. Unfortunately, the game
  still stalls on MCI_PLAY commands. Apparently, every thread in the process
  calling mciSendCommand() is halted until the play has begun. :-( Even
  though the separate thread turned out to be useless, I'm keeping this
  architecture, because if there is someway to avoid the pause, it probably
  won't be by using the game thread for CD control.

June 3, 2000
- Started work on CD support after (finally) finding information about using
  different CD drives hidden in the Microsoft Knowledgebase.
- Added Win32 clipboard support (copy & paste) to the console and chat mode.

May 29, 2000
- Implemented some spiffy interpolated path stuff: APathFollower,
  AMovingCamera, and AActorMover.
- SetPlayerProperty should work in open scripts now. Needed to make sure it
  was non-NULL.

May 24, 2000
- Did a release build under Win98, and it took ~4.25 minutes to link--about
  twice as long as NT. Ack!
- Fixed improperly freeing a MUSSong after playing a MIDI. I guess
  redefined virtual member functions for subclasses don't work in a
  superclass's destructor. (Which makes sense, since the subclass's stuff
  is already gone by the time any classes it's derived from destruct.) So
  I replaced MIDISong::IsMUS() with a variable MUSSong::m_IsMUS.

May 2, 2000
- Seem to have fixed 3D sound crashes; listener position and velocity were
  being calculated using FLOAT2FIXED instead of FIXED2FLOAT, so they were
  very big and apparently overflowed the drivers. Unfortunately, the sounds
  are really noisy.

April 28, 2000
- Revised the event system by creating a generic EV_GUI_Event type in
  anticipation of creating at least a minimal windowing system. The console
  now uses this system for input, which will hopefully resolve certain
  console key down misses under NT. (Running 98 right now, so can't check.)

April 27, 2000
- Tried to add 3D sound support. Gave up after several nasty crashes that
  left me with no clue what I was doing wrong.

April 13, 2000
- Fixed P_DamageMobj not pushing things if the source was a player.

April 11, 2000
- Increased map and world variable counts to the amounts Ty Halderman raised
  them to in acc.
- Implemented clearinventory, checkinventory, giveinventory, and takeinventory
  ACS functions. Still need to test them.
- Added support for playing a specific order of a MOD and changing the song
  from ACS.

April 10, 2000
- Skins with sounds that precede the S_SKIN identifier now work. A side-effect
  of this is that skin wads can no longer replace non-skin resources. (This is
  intentional.)
- Added the sc_carry_players type to DScroller, which only carries players
  (hence the name), to match Heretic and Hexen.
- Added an MF3_CARRIED flag to keep track of which actors have been pushed
  by a DScroller, so that adjacent small sectors with the same scrolliness
  do not have cumulative effects on a thing.
- Changed I_StartSound to let FMOD pick a free channel at the suggestion
  someone e-mailed to me. It still seems to work for me, and hopefully it
  will work for everyone else now, too.

April 4, 2000
- Why did I decide to use the MFC names for the macros RUNTIME_TYPE and
  RUNTIME_CLASS? It's confusing. _TYPE: Return the TypeInfo for an existing
  instance of an object. _CLASS: Return the TypeInfo for a class.
- Fixed running with -nosfx crashing the game when trying to play a MOD/MP3.

April 3, 2000
- Change P_Move() again so that monsters stepping down steps move down
  immediately instead of falling under gravity because it looks better.
- Changed FMOD initialization sequence to be more tolerant of failure.
- Added checks for self->target to the A_FatAttack? routines.

March 29, 2000
- Fixed dehacked patches changing "BFG Cells/Shot".
- Fixed PickPrevWeapon to properly wrap from low to slot 0 to 9.

March 28, 2000
- Added the ACS internal functions spawn and spawnspot. Also added support
  internal functions with optional parameters to acc.
- Fixed console not maintaining correct text color when splitting lines.

March 27, 2000
- Fixed ACS sound commands only supporting volumes 0 and 127 (was not
  converting to float when dividing).
- Changed the status bar number drawers to round down to the closest "good"
  number if the space allocated for the number's display is too small.
- Changed friendly fire so that it is a scaler like UT, and not a simple
  on-off dmflag. Of course, this means it's a cvar now.
- Changed teamplay so you can still hurt yourself even if you can't hurt your
  teammates. You can also telefrag teammates now in those instances where you
  happen to respawn where a teammate is standing.
- Added MF3_NOTARGET flag so that Heretic bosses can be ignored if they happen
  to hurt something, but Doom bosses are not.
- Added a playerinfo command to peek at the userinfo for any player in
  the game.
- Fixed D_ReadUserInfoStrings() ignoring the last value in a compacted
  userinfo list, causing neverswitchonpickup to not be replicated during
  netgame startup.

March 25, 2000
- Skins with no frames get removed from the list.
- Duplicate skins get renamed to avoid conflicts.

March 24, 2000
- Fixed crash when running with +set developer 1.
- Fixed savegame slots drawn too high in the Doom menus. (I unwittingly
  raised them at some point.)
- Turend off auto-monster respawning on skill 4 when not playing Doom.
- Fixed locked, repeatable, local doors being translated with their tags
  intact (should be 0).
- Disabled highlighting of teleport lines if their activation type is
  monster cross.
- Added support for Doom maps that use teleport dests in sectors with 0 tags.
- Fixed Heretic stair speeds (was 1/4 too slow, because they were going at
  Doom speed).
- Fixed cursor drawn in wrong column on video modes menu. (184 is not the
  same as 104.)

March 13, 2000
- Linking the release build now takes 2:35. :-(
- Added some more debug output to i_sound.cpp.
- Added a hack to PIT_RadiusAttack() to make the Romero head easier to hit.
- Fixed rippers doing no damage because P_CreateSecNodList() altered tmthing.
- Fixed the holdatkstate used by the powered-up phoenix rod.
- Fixed "bouncing" problems when standing still on the waggly muck in
  Hexen map08.
- Discovered only players were having their z velocity reset to 0 when they
  hit the floor. Fixed. Now I don't need the MF_CRASHED flag I added earlier.
- Made demon scroller more efficient.
- Fixed bunny scroller showing end screen for first 230 tics.
- Changed quit message for non-Doom games.

March 8, 2000
- Fixed New Game menu not displaying properly with Ultimate Doom.
- Made FImageCollection::Uninit() more complete to avoid potential problems
  when turning off the crosshair.

March 6, 2000
- Stepping out of a floorclipping sector now adjusts the player's viewheight.
- Added the Hexen decorations.

March 5, 2000
- Tweaked P_CheckPosition() some more.
- Changed DThinker::DestroyAllThinkers() to call EndFrame() after each
  thinker gets destroyed.

March 2, 2000
- Fixed console not showing top line of its buffer.
- Made some DeHackEd compatibility fixes.
- Fixed stealth Hell Knight having same doomednum as stealth Baron.
- Changed sound code to not override sounds with the same priority. Fixes
  continuous ambient sounds fighting for the same channel in low channel
  environments. (e.g. only one sfx channel)
- Fixed the monster morphers to transfer tids and specials to the morphed
  monsters.
- Fixed ambient sounds replaying too soon (i.e. one tic after they start).
- Changed DoLoad in i_sound.cpp to use FSOUND_Sample_Upload instead of
  FSOUND_Sample_Lock. Hopefully will fix sound problems on some cards.
- Fixed PatchAmmo() not checking to make sure a weapon is present before
  checking its ammo member.

March 1, 2000
- Added dummy entries for the splash sounds to the Doom section of zdoom.wad's
  SNDINFO to avoid warnings when starting Doom.
- Set BaronOfHell to proper mass.
- Modified DObject::DestroyScan (both versions) to scan each sector's
  soundtarget field if a destroyed object is a PlayerPawn and clear
  matching fields.
- Made jumping velocity a PlayerPawn property
- Set MF3_DONTSPLASH for chicken feathers.
- Fixed Heretic secret level exits.
- Fixed imps/lost souls slamming into things and crashing because they
  ended up calling P_CheckPosition recursively.
- Fixed crashing when trying to scroll past the top of options menus that
  fit entirely on the screen.
- Added Hexen cheats. (Note that not all Heretic and Hexen cheats are
  implemented, because I didn't feel it was worth reimplementing their
  behavior--such as Heretic's gimme or Hexen's version of the same).

February 29, 2000
- Redid cheat parser and added Heretic cheats.
- Added heretic.wad, heretic1.wad, and hexen.wad to the list of iwads
  searched for.
- Fixed to properly detect and use shareware heretic1.wad.
- Fixed morphed player making normal player pain sounds.
- Fixed P_MorphPlayer not setting camera and morphTics.
- Fixed activated monsters not triggering SPAC_MCROSS lines, because
  AActor::Activate was clearing everything in flags2. (Used ! instead of ~).
- Fixed mapthings being spawned with wrong angles due to round-off error.
- FWeaponSlot::AddWeapon no longer adds a single weapon to a slot more than
  once. Fixes nextweap not working with fast monsters. They were added once
  at init time, and again when fast monsters were set.
- Added LeavingIntermission state for intermission to avoid trying to draw
  after the graphics have been freed.
- Loaded BigFont for Doom game.

February 27, 2000
- Implemented infinite ammo option for Heretic weapons.
- Set particle fountain heights back to 0 (missed them during conversion).
- Added option to flip player view in player setup menu between front
  and back.
- Fixed stepping onto a thing and getting stuck inside another thing
  above you.
- Fixed crash when starting with -loadgame.
- Fixed moving into walls when on top of things (such as when killing
  something next to a wall with gauntlets and being pulled forward on top
  of the dead thing before it clears MF_SOLID).
- Fixed text aligned improperly at high resolutions on the intermission's
  "now entering" screen.
- Fixed missiles climbing up steps before exploding (very noticeable with
  mace balls.)
- Gave AMaceFX1 MF_DROPOFF. (It was missing it.)
- Fixed P_HitFloor to return true/false based on the floor's liquid status.
- Fixed Heretic weapons drawn too high at high resolutions with st_scale 0.
- Fixed mummies not attacking you. Forgot to uncomment some stuff I had
  commented out for checking the collision detection.

February 25, 2000
- Did a release build and timed it as ~70 seconds spent linking.
- Disabled messagemode when confirmation messages are up.
- Switched to the console font to display key names in the controls menu,
  because the Raven fonts don't have enough characters for all the keys.

February 24, 2000
- Gave the Heretic imp chunks masses of 5 so they make small splashes.
- Made the color for locked doors default to green.
- Added more items to the controls menu and made it scrollable.
- Doom, Heretic, and Hexen now use separate config files.

February 23, 2000
- Added support for a TERRAIN lump.

February 22, 2000
- Added translations for Heretic's skullrod rain, lifegem, and player cape.

February 21, 2000
- Tried making the chasecam use the player's viewheight to smoothly move
  itself up when the player stepped up, but it looked odd to see the player
  jump up while the camera moved smoothly, so I took it out.
- Wrote 4 different iterators for P_ChangeSector that should be able to
  properly handle moving things standing on top of other things. Such
  situations were completely ignored before.
- Removed limit on intercepts.

February 20, 2000
- Fixed setting skill from menu when fullscreen console is active.

February 18, 2000
- Fixed annoying screen "jiggling" when jumping up onto ledges.
- Fixed Plat_DownByValue handling.
- Fixed a lockup problem in situations where stairs are triggered and then
  retriggered, but from the opposite end.

February 15, 2000
- Fixed the display of the player's name on spynext/prev.
- Added the FHUDMessage class and change C_MidPrint to use it. This class
  can be used to display text at any location on-screen and is patterned
  after Half-Life's text messages. Additional effects besides plain on and
  off are accomplished by subclassing it.
- Reimplemented Doom's status bar.
- Fixed instances when bots were not respawning themselves.
- Fixed bodyque so that it is actually used again.
- Fixed an (obscure?) error when a thinker destroys the next thinker
  scheduled for thinking while it thinks. The problem can be reproduced
  with the following steps using a deathmatch map with only one start, one
  player, and weapondrop on: 1. You spawn. 2. You spawn a bot without moving.
  3. The bot telefrags you. 4. You drop a clip, then the bot picks it up
  when it moves and destroys it. 5. Because DThinker::RunThinkers() had cached
  the next thinker, it doesn't know the clip was destroyed and tries to make
  it think. The clip thinks, and relinks itself into the world, and causes a
  whole bunch of problems.

February 14, 2000
- Tried separating the different game directories into static libraries to
  see if that would reduce the link time. It didn't seem to have made
  much of a difference, and some classes weren't being linked into the
  executable, so I went back to linking everything together into a single
  executable without any intermediate libraries. The different game
  directories stayed, though, since I like the organization.

February 13, 2000
- Made the Heretic and Hexen scrollers accurately mimic their counterparts
  from those games.
- Added more endgame types, including a customizable picture viewer.

February 12, 2000
- Also in the way of movement code, I fixed a problem that caused the
  player's view to jump drastically when jumping onto another thing,
  because I was using the player's z in two places where it should have
  been the other thing's z.
- After much juggling, I believe I finally have the movement code fixed so
  that floating monsters won't float themselves into other monsters. Testing
  was done in Heretic E1M1 by summoning a bunch of mummies and wizards.
  I also cleaned up P_FakeZMovement() so that it's much leaner. I was able
  to find the following causes of the problem: 1. When monsters went up
  steps, they didn't check to make sure there was nothing in the way above
  them. 2. When P_CheckOnmobj() found a monster's move to be blocked, the
  monster could still float down inside the head of its blocker, causing
  the blocking monster to get stuck until it floated up again.

February 9, 2000
- Added fixeddiv, fixedmul, setgravity, and setaircontrol commands to acs.
- Added floorclipping from Hexen/Heretic.
- Moved the turn180 code over to P_PlayerThink.

February 2, 2000
- Got ZDoom to link against ELK and run. While trying to get a setup that
  worked properly with the Scheme reset procedure, I accidentally got a
  setup where Scheme code was calling the main loop every tic. The result
  was that it had to garbage collect a lot. And then I realized that
  Scheme is not the way to go for implementing a real-time game scripting
  language. If the GC has to work a lot when we only call a single
  procedure 35 times a second, think how horrible it would be if 100
  different procedures were called that often (for 100 different actors).
  Ugh. I think I'll do something with ACS instead.

February 1, 2000
- Got ELK (Extension Language Kit) to compile into a usable library. The
  idea was to use it as a simple way for the end user to create new action
  functions for actors.

January 1, 2000
- Fixed P_FakeZMovement so it knows about underwater movement.
- Added a workaround for the imps continuosly performing their crashstate.
  When P_ZMovement sets the crashstate, it also sets a MF_CRASHED flag, so
  it knows not to do it again. I can't see why Heretic doesn't exhibit
  the same problem. :-(

December 30, 1999
- Changed the changemap command to return harmlessly if called without an
  instigator.
- Tried adding the Heretic Imp, and it worked, kind of; the imps continuosly
  spew chunks of flesh when they hit the ground after death.

December 29, 1999
- Changed mobjinfo handling so they get set by a class' SetDefaults() method.
  This means that every actor needs to have its own class, but they get more
  control over their defaults depending on the game mode, and it also
  condenses code some, because they only need to list the values different
  from the actor defaults.

December 17, 1999
- Added the dumpmapthings command.
- Removed the testgibs cvar.
- Added angle and speed parameters to security cameras, so now they can turn
  like Duke's. Also add pitch parameter.
- Made ambient sounds recognize activate and deactivate.
- In DCajunMaster::FakeFire(), the maximum distance a bot will trace is now
  SAFE_SELF_MISDIST. Since they will fire if the trace would have hit
  something past this, there's no sense in wasting time going further if the
  trace hasn't hit anything by the time it gets that far away.

December 16, 1999
- Set the default for fullscreen under Win32 back to 1. Not sure why I had
  it at 0.
- Made mobjinfos dynamic so they don't need to be in one monolithic info.cpp.
  Now they can be in the file with their related code, and subclassing AActor
  is useful.

December 12, 1999
- Changed DPolyAction::m_Dist to be signed. I'm not sure why I changed it
  to unsigned, because there are lots of places where it gets checked if
  it's less than zero.
- Added sorting of the cvars that get sent during netgame arbitration. In
  the old system, they were sent out in whatever order they were registered,
  which was compiler-dependant. This worked fine when playing against a copy
  built with the same compiler, but broke when trying to play a version
  built with a different compiler. Thus, Windows, Linux, and OSF/1 versions
  could not play each other.

December 11, 1999
- Made some changes to get the code to compile and run without
  unaligned accesses on Alpha processors. ZDoom will now compile and run
  under OSF/1. It appears to play ordinary Doom levels properly. Levels
  with Hexen features will crash it, and savegames seem to have problems,
  too. (Some of which, I think, is attributable to using LZO for
  compression. It apparently isn't 64-bit friendly.)

November 30, 1999
- Made the Scroll_Texture_Both and TranslucentLine specials dynamic.
  That is, they can be used from inside the game after the level is
  loaded.

November 26, 1999
- Added the hud_scale cvar to control scaling of the fullscreen hud.
- Removed targettic from AActor, because it's no longer meaningful (and
  hasn't been for quite a while). Replaced it with dummies in the
  AActor serializer so that savegame compatibility can be retained.
- Fixed a next thinker determination problem in DThinker::RunThinkers().
  A thinker can destroy itself during its RunThink(), so the next thinker
  to run needs to be determined before we run the current thinker, not
  after.
- Added calls to I_FinishUpdateNoBlit() and I_BeginUpdate() at
  strategic locations in R_RenderPlayerView().

November 25, 1999
- Removed the outer layer of compression from savegames. Since all
  the snapshots in the savegame are already compressed, compressing
  them again will do little good.
- Fixed archiving of defered ACS scripts. There were actually two
  problems here. One, if there were any, it would get stuck in an
  infinite loop. Two, they were being saved in a format different
  from what they were being loaded as.
- Fixed the operation of FLZOMemFile's serializer so that it restores
  to the state it was archived in (e.g. an imploded file stored in
  m_ImplodedBuffer, as opposed to an uncompressed file stored in
  m_BUffer).

November 24, 1999
- Fixed BOOM generalized locked doors so that the open/close type will
  actually close.

November 23, 1999
- Machines that use -join will now select their port automatically.
- Here's another problem the bots helped me catch: DThinker::
  DestroyAllThinkers() was still deleting each thinker. The correct
  approach now is to call Destroy() on each thinker, and then call
  DObject::EndFrame() to perform the actual deletion.
- Those bots are great for stress testing. Thanks to them, I was able to
  find and correct a problem with my Destroy() implementation: DThinker
  also needs to implement Destroy() to get the object out of the thinker
  list. Otherwise, you can do things like destroy an actor, then have
  the thinking code move it before it gets removed from the thinker list,
  which leaves the block and/or sector pointers messed up and causes all
  sorts of odd and nasty behavior.

October 27, 1999
- Added my own fixes for -host and -join to handle aborts better.
- Tweaked underwater friction in P_GetFriction().
- Added Jeffrey Cuenco's fixes for the -host and -join parameters.

October 26, 1999
- Added a check in A_Scream() to make sure the actor has a death sound.
- Fixed demo sync problems caused by playing demos back with a cl_pufftype
  different from what they were recorded with. I have no idea why it should
  make a difference, since the puffs are supposed to be inert, but spawning
  them and keeping them hidden when cl_pufftype is 1 fixes the problem.
- Implemented stale pointer cleaning. If you want to remove an object now,
  call its Destroy() method instead of deleting it. The object will be
  placed in a queue. At the end of the frame, all objects will be scanned
  for references to objects in the queue, and any references that are found
  will be NULLed. Then the objects will be deleted.

  Any objects that have (DObject *) (or some subclass of DObject) members
  need to be implemented with the IMPLEMENT_POINTY_SERIAL or
  IMPLEMENT_POINTY_CLASS macros. See the implementation of AActor in
  p_mobj.cpp for an example of their use.

September 15, 1999
- Fixed a nasty bug when saving big games. FArchive used pointers into the
  m_ObjectMap array when mapping objects to indices. Now it uses indices
  all the way through so that they will still remain valid if m_ObjectMap
  has to grow.
- Reduced the rate at which arbitration packets are sent out to 4 times per
  second. Combined with their reduced size, this will hopefully solve
  problems I understand some people were having using 1.18 with DoomServ.
  (Based on the assumption that their problems were caused by the lack of
  bandwidth offered by modems.)
- Reduced the size of netgame arbitration packets by removing the names of
  the cvars the values represent. When playing with the same copy of the
  executable, these are implicit in the order in which the values appear in
  the stream, so storing the name of the key is essentially redundant.
- Pulled out the original 1.18a source and fixed loading of savegames before
  a new game is begun. The problem was in DCajunMaster::RemoveAllBots(),
  where the consoleplayer's camera is restored to the console player if
  viewing a bot. Before the game begins, the camera field is NULL. Also
  changed caught recoverable errors so that bots are removed and level
  snapshots are deleted.

September 12, 1999
- Made actor movement floating-point based. I had already done the fp time
  system (to an extent) before I had to pull out the 1.18 source and fix
  bugs. Gravity seems to be inversely proportional to the ticrate. Can't
  figure out why.

Okay, I was stupid. I accidentally erased the version of the log file that
contained my changes from 1.18 to 1.18a.

September 5, 1999
- The +moveup and +movedown commands finally do something.
- Added a fly cheat.
- Changed the handling of action commands so that they increment and
  decrement numbers in an array instead of setting and clearing bits in an
  int.
- Fixed R_AlignFlat(). Apparently, I broke it sometime (or it never worked
  properly in the first place). Also made it simpler.

September 3, 1999
- Added localambientsound and activatorsound ACS commands.
- Fixed the DLevelScript constructor to place new scripts in the array of
  RunningScripts (if not ACS_ExecuteAlways).

September 2, 1999
- Replaced the error abort in FArchive.cpp when an attempt is made to store
  a DObject, with a NULL object save instead. There are conditions that will
  come up during regular gameplay that will result in dangling pointers.
  Example: A lost soul attacks a monster. The attacked monster then sets its
  target field to the lost soul. Something kills the lost soul, and it
  destroys itself. The other monster is now left with a pointer to nowhere.
  The only reasonable solution to this problem I can think of is to collect
  a list of all objects that want to destroy themselves. At the end of each
  tic, they get destroyed, *and* all thinkers are searched for pointers to
  those object. If any pointers are found, they get NULLed.

September 1, 1999
- Significantly cleaned up G_ParseMapInfo(). It's easier to follow what it's
  doing, and now it's smart enough to give you an error message if you make
  a mistake in your MAPINFO lump instead of hanging.
- Added a flat warping effect similar to Quake's liquid textures.

August 31, 1999
- Added swimmable water. The forcewater cvar can be used to make all BOOM
  deep water swimmable.
- C_MidPrint() now adds messages to the console as well as the middle of
  the screen.
- Fixed the "you need a key" messages to only appear for the player who
  tries to activate the locked door.
- Restored the code for storing server cvars in savegames.

August 30, 1999
- Made items respawn the default for -deathmatch.
- After creating some huge log files, I believe I finally fixed the demo
  and network sync with bots. The bots use P_CheckPosition() to determine
  if a spot is free. This function can also causes items to be picked up.
  Thus, on the arbitrator's machine, bots pick up items before they do
  on the other machines, and they can also pick up items that they decide
  not to touch (and so don't pick them up on other machines). To fix, I
  made a wrapper for the bots that turns off their MF_PICKUP flag before
  performing the check and then sets it back after the check is made.
- Fixed the loading of the "straight-ahead" status bar graphics for skins.
  The corresponding patches weren't being moved into the skin's namespace.

August 28, 1999
- Fixed the bot's FakeFire() so that it doesn't do damage to anything
  that it might hit, by adding another thing instead of using MT_HEADSHOT.
- Another cause of the sync problem is in P_CheckSight(). If a monster
  is invisible, a random number is used to determine if the thing
  should be reported as not visible.
- Found part of the problem with bot sync: P_SpawnPlayerMissile() used
  a special routine when a bot wanted to fire. The routine aimed at
  whatever the bot's enemy was set at. Only on the arbitrary (and not
  during demo playback), can enemy ever be non-NULL. Changed this to
  just disable autoaim for bots. Should be effectively the same.
- Changed P_SpawnPlayerMissile() so that if a player has autoaim set to
  0, it doesn't try adjusting the angle left and right.
- Fixed projectile velocities by using vector math. Doom calculated the
  velocity on a 2D plane, then added in the vertical component.
- Fixed the bot's vertical aiming.
- Rewrote the parts of the Cajun that used degrees to use binary angles
  instead.
- Changed the Cajun's TurnToAng() function to let it turn both left and
  right, depending on which results in a shorter distance.

August 27, 1999
- Added the Cajun 0.97 code. Needs work yet: Bot looks up/down too far,
  always turns right, demos don't stay in sync, and networking with bots
  probably doesn't work either.

August 14, 1999
- Cleaned out a lot of the no longer relevant docs from the docs dir that
  came from the Linux source.
- Changed IdentifyVersion() so that it can look for an IWAD in one of four
  directories: current, program, $DOOMWADDIR, and $HOME. (The same search
  order used by BOOM.)

August 13, 1999
- Fixed the DLevelScript constructor. (Using local vars with the same names
  as member vars still isn't a good thing. :-)

August 12, 1999
- Made the vertical calculations in the renderer subpixel-accurate. This
  negates some of the work I did on the 10th. A pity. Something also needs to
  be done about the walls--they are horribly jittery.
- Moved the calculation of the initial texture coordinate out of the column
  drawers and into their callers. Besides making the column drawers simpler,
  it also allows for some optimizations of masked texture/sprite rendering,
  where the initial coordinate is almost always 0.
- Added variable field of view. Use the fov command to change it.

August 11, 1999
- When using -nosound, MIDAS's dsmClearBufferFloat() sometimes tries to free
  memory that isn't allocated (apparently already freed). To compensate, I
  avoid initializing MIDAS when -nosound or -nosfx is specified instead of
  setting MIDAS's nosound option.
- Found that when a stat display is active when the game is quit, a pure
  virtual function call was being made. Unfortunately, when I tried to track
  it down, the problem stopped.
- Optimized away two multiplies I had added to R_MapPlane() earlier. Oddly,
  performance seems unaffected.

August 10, 1999
- Did some performance tuning for the yslope movement loop in
  R_SetupFrame(). memmove() is not an intrinsic function, so I wrote some
  loops that VC++ optimizes nicely. (Other optimizing compilers should be
  able to do the job just as well.) I also split up the loop that calculates
  the yslope values into three cases so that the body of the loop can be as
  simple as possible.
  It probably wasn't worth the effort...
- Changed P_SpawnPlayer to set player_t::attacker to NULL so that invalid
  attackers aren't carried over across levels, which can cause the problems
  if you try to save your game before being attacked on the new level.
- Finished reimplementing hub travel. The new code in FArchive worked
  properly on the first try. (Yay!)

August 7, 1999
- Added some code to FArchive that distinguishes player-controlled actors
  (but not voodoo dolls) so that the stored actors can be overridden by
  explicitly spawned ones when travelling between levels in a hud. Untested,
  but I think it should work.
- For curiosity's sake, a did a comparison of savegame sizes with 1.17c and
  test9. The map tested was map29, just after spawning. The 1.17c snapshot
  for the level was 99542 bytes uncompressed (20659 compressed). The test9
  snapshot was 111786 bytes uncompressed (14824 compressed). So the new
  archive format is bigger but compresses better, which I'll consider to be
  a good thing, because snapshots are normally stored in memory in their
  compressed state.

August 6, 1999
- Changed the tag changing behavior of W_CacheLumpNum(). Before, it would
  always change a block's tag. Now, it will only change the tag if the new
  one is less than the previous. This way, a block can be promoted from
  PU_CACHE to PU_STATIC, but not the other way around. This was the cause
  of intermittant bugs that were visible in st_new.cpp. ST_New uses some
  graphics that also serve as sprite graphics. When those sprites are drawn,
  their tags were changed to PU_CACHE, and with enough spawning, their data
  could be overwritten, and st_new would never know.

August 5, 1999
- Changed M_Drawer() to use V_BreakLines() to split lines for prompt
  messages, because it wasn't working right. Also fixed a bug in
  V_BreakLines() so that now it will recognize blank lines.
- Added nofilecompression cvar to prevent compression of LZO files.
- Fixed savegames.
- Made the thinkers the first thing that gets serialized in a level
  snapshot (instead of sectors and walls), because a sector's specialdata
  fields might cause a thinker to be serialized. But when
  DThinker::SerializeAll is called, it destroys all existing thinkers,
  including the ones that were created while reading the sectors. Storing
  the thinkers before anything else avoids this.
- Moved the serialization of player data into G_SerializeLevel. The bots
  use pointers to some actors in their player_t, so we need to keep the
  player data in the same context as the actors they reference. (i.e. They
  need to go in the level snapshot instead of outside of them as was done
  previously.)
- Also fixed a bug with FLZOFile::Write. If a large write request was made,
  it would only double the amount of memory to store the file in, which
  might not have been enough. Now it doubles it until the buffer is large
  enough to store the new data.
- Figured out what was wrong with storing FLZOMemFiles in an archive: I was
  forgetting to add the 8 bytes of header to the size of the block to write
  out.

August 4, 1999
- Hubs somewhat work. Level data is properly stored on exit and loaded when
  reentering the level. I just need to fix the player spawning. Savegames
  are another matter. I seem to be having trouble embedding an FLZOMemFile
  inside an archive. It appears to be getting saved properly, but trying to
  decompress it crashes.
- Got the FArchive class working. It is now able to write out objects and
  reconstruct them, filling in pointers as appropriate. Cool.

August 3, 1999
- Instead of relying on Z_FreeTags to remove all thinkers when a new level
  is started, I now call DThinker::RemoveAllThinkers, so that any subclasses
  of DThinker that have custom destructors can have them called. Currently,
  the only one with a destructor is DACSThinker, which destroys all the
  active scripts.
- Created a thinker responsible for running the ACS scripts, because it
  makes serializing them easier.
- Moved some of the mobj handling functions into the AActor class. Most
  notably, P_SpawnMobj and P_RemoveMobj are gone. Use the new and delete
  operators instead. AActor has a constructor that takes the same parameters
  as P_SpawnMobj, so converting old code to use new is easy enough.

August 1, 1999
- Changed the code in i_music.cpp to use a simple class hierarchy for
  defining music formats and how to play them. This removed some (messy)
  switch statements and the nameless unions (that I guess mingw32 chokes on).
- Rearranged the atterm functions so that I_ShutdownMusic() is called before
  I_ShutdownSound() to prevent crashes when a MOD is playing at shutdown time.

July 31, 1999
- Removed the lists of active ceilings and plats, mainly because it makes
  the serialization code simpler, but also because the same result can be
  achieved (albeit more slowly) by searching the list of thinkers for each
  instance of DCeiling or DPlat.
- Made the active buttons (button_t) and earthquakes (quake_t) subclasses of
  DThinker (DActiveButton and DEarthquake, respectively).
- Created a TThinkerIterator template class to manage iterating through the
  list of active thinkers.

July 28, 1999
- Ever since I added the extra network commands (like say) around a year ago,
  I have been executing them the instant they arrived from the network. I
  have only now figured out that this is wrong. They should be stored and
  only executed when the gametic they arrived with is executed. With commands
  like say, the timing is unimportant. With other commands, like changemap,
  it can be vital that all machines execute the command on the same gametic.
- Made some changes to the ticcmd building code in d_net.cpp to compensate
  for ticdups greater than 1 by dividing pitch and yaw deltas by the ticdup
  value so that the end result of moving the mouse a certain distance is the
  same as if a ticdup of 1 were used. This is also necessary to make bots
  work with ticdups other than 1.
- Fixed the crazy bot turning. The cause? I was calculating angle deltas for
  the bots' ticcmds based on their yaw when their think routine was called.
  This is incorrect, because that yaw can incorrectly reflect the state of
  the current gametic, because maketic can be more than 1 tic in advance of
  gametic. The correct way is to take the bot's current yaw, add all the
  deltas that haven't been played yet to it, and using the resulting yaw as
  the base for the current maketic's yaw delta. In some ways, this is exactly
  what you would also do for player prediction.

July 26, 1999
- Removed G_InitPlayer(). It was never used and just called G_PlayerReborn().

July 23, 1999
- Spent too many hours tracking down a circular #include dependancy I had
  inadvertantly created yesterday.

July 22, 1999
- Did some work with the savegame serialization.

July 21, 1999
- Changed P_SpawnMapThing() to silently reject mapthings of type -1.
- Fixed kill command to restore player's MF_SHOOTABLE flag before doing the
  damage.
- Changed bot observer mode to use noclip instead of noblockmap. Otherwise,
  the player is unable to ride lifts while observing.
- The bot code spawns bglobal.body1 and bglobal.body2 actors to help with
  aiming. The original code would carry pointers to these over between
  levels, even though all actors disappear when travelling between levels.
  Not a good thing. Fixed.

July 20, 1999
- Changed the network code so that now bots work in network games. Their
  ticcmds are sent along with the arbitrator's to the other players in the
  game. This way, only one computer is responsible for doing the bot
  thinking. (BOOM's random number generator was extremely useful for this.)
  Unfortunately, the bots seem to have trouble aiming with more than one
  live player and often end up spinning wildly.
- Made weapondrop a server variable.
- Fixed bots so that they can be recorded in savegames. There were two things
  preventing it before: 1) The bots ticcmd was being written directly to the
  player structure instead of netcmds, so the demo writer never had a change
  to see the bot's commands. 2) There are several places in the bot code that
  fiddle with the bot's angle directly. The quick (and acceptable) fix was to
  keep the fiddling in, but use the new angle to calculate the bot's ucmd.yaw
  value and set its angle back to what it was before being fiddled.
- Delayed the call to I_InitMusic() in I_InitSound() until after MIDAS
  is initialized. Also removed the call to I_ShutdownMusic() in I_InitSound(),
  since I_ShutdownMusic() will be called automatically at exit.

July 19, 1999
- Made the network arbitrator changeable, so that if player 1 leaves the game,
  someone will still be able to control things.
- Moved the call to I_FinishClockCalibration() before D_CheckNetGame().

July 17, 1999
- Changed several references in am_map.cpp from plr to the console player's
  camera. Also added colors for inter- and intra-level teleporters.
- Changed P_PlayerThink() so that the game doesn't die if you try to add more
  bots than there are coop starts (in a coop game, of course).
- Fixed removebots command so that if you are looking through a bot's eyes
  when you remove the bots, your vision is restored to your own head.

July 16, 1999
- Fixed the rotation of player arrows in the rotating automap in coop games.
- Changed wipe_initBurn to allocate FIREHEIGHT+5 rows. Apparently FIREHEIGHT+4
  wasn't enough.
- Fixed SN_StartSequence so that it doesn't attempt to play nonassigned
  sequences. I had broken it when I separated part of the code into a
  separate TwiddleSeqNum function.

July 14, 1999
- Moved the "VectorCopy (RailEnd, end);" line in P_RailAttack() in front of
  the for loop.

July 12, 1999
- Enclosed the bot thinking code inside if (bglobal.botnum) {} blocks so that
  no bot thinking occurs when there are no bots. Also defaulted bot_calcnodes
  to 0. If a bot is spawned, and there are no nodes loaded, bot_calcnodes
  will automatically be set to 1. Now the bots don't eat up any time if none
  are present in the world.
- Added a generic FStat class. Different statistics can be measured and
  reported by subclassing it. The console command "stat" provides the
  interface to select which stats to view.
- You cannot directly call a constructor from inside another constructor to
  help do initialization. Instead, you end up with a temporary object that
  is destroyed immediately when the second constructor finishes. This was
  causing crashes with wall scrollers, because their constructor was calling
  the constructor for more general scrollers.

July 11, 1999
- Changed the bot code so that it doesn't go into multiplayer mode until
  after a bot is spawned, so the game won't be in coop mode when players have
  no intention of playing with bots.

July 10, 1999
- Changed ReplaceString() function to properly handle the case where the 
  string being replaced is the same as the new one.
- Cajun bot now runs under ZDoom, although some things aren't perfect (such
  as skin color).

July 9, 1999
- Received the Cajun bot source. Started moving it to ZDoom.

July 7, 1999
- The sky can now scale horizontally as well as vertically (when using
  r_stretchsky), so its aspect ratio is preserved when stretched.
- Redid the Wu line drawer to support 64 intensity levels and wrote a version
  that used the translucency tables so that it could look good in overlayed
  mode. Also cleaned up the code to make it more readable (to me anyway) and
  removed the use of short ints.

July 6, 1999
- Restored Cmd_Exec to its 1.17c version. I'm not sure what I was trying to
  accomplish with the changes I made, but they broke it under certain
  situations.

July 5, 1999
- Added Heretic's anti-aliased Wu line drawer to the automap.
- Delayed the execution of cvar callbacks until the video subsystem has been
  initialized.

July 3, 1999
- ST_Start() now sets the status bar dimensions.
- Fixed some of the DCanvas member functions that used width and height as
  parameters. Having two function parameters with the same names as two
  member variables is not a good thing...

July 2, 1999
- Converted screen_t to class DCanvas and moved a bunch of the screen drawing
  functions into it. This let me catch a few instances where the screen
  dimensions were being referenced before they were initialized.
- Found this code in i_input.cpp under WM_ACTIVATE:
		if (Fullscreen)
		{
			extern int DisplayWidth, DisplayHeight, DisplayBits;
			I_SetMode (DisplayWidth, DisplayHeight, DisplayBits);
		}
  Apparently, I added it when converting the video code to OpenPTC and
  completely forgot about it. I still don't remember adding it. This was
  probably the cause of problems starting up in fullscreen mode with some
  chipsets. (Banshee and Voodoo3 are the two I know about.)
- Changed refreshDisplay() in i_video.cpp to not do anything during startup.
- Added a WM_GETMINMAXINFO handler to prevent the user from shrinking the
  window smaller than the surface.

July 1, 1999
- Added default aliases for idclip and idspispopd that point to noclip.
- Further fleshed out the DConsoleCommand and DConsoleAlias classes. Commands
  and aliases are now hashed in the same array, and aliases get saved to the
  config file again.
- Changed PIT_ChangeSector() to not call P_DamageMobj() if the crushing damage
  is 0. This is the way it used to be in Doom (so I hear; I don't feel like
  checking), but not in Hexen.
- Added a check to P_SpawnMapThing() to not bother checking mapthings of
  type 0. Apparently, some maps in Final Doom actually have these.
- DActor.movecount needs to be signed; there are places in p_enemy.cpp that
  test if it is < 0. I had changed it to unsigned. Making it signed again
  fixed the problem in test1 that made monsters act as if they had "bad
  vision."
- Changed P_AimLineAttack to calculate the top and bottom slope based on a
  spherical 64 degree vertical field of view instead of just adding some
  values to the center slope. With things that look straight ahead, the
  result is the same as the original Doom. With things that don't, the result
  is more correct than before. Also fixes the BFG problem in test1.

June 30, 1999
- Did some cleanup. Released 118test1.

June 29, 1999
- Made the actor's pitch member variable represent an angle between -ANGLE_90
  and +ANGLE_90 exclusive instead of a screen sliding amount. Now the same
  representation can be used for the current engine and any possible future
  ones that offer true 6 DOF. This also makes the relationship between pitch
  and all the slope values Doom uses for collision detection more apparent--
  just take the tangent of the pitch instead of multiplying it by a magic
  number.

June 23, 1999
- Moved the multiplication by lightscalexmul out of the inner wall
  rendering loop so that it can be stepped instead, saving all the time I
  used to be spending multiplying.
- Finished converting all cvars to a cvar_t class. Use the macros defined in
  c_cvars.h for declaring them. One (possibly significant for mods) change
  is that callback functions are now always called when a cvar is created.
  If callback depends on something else being initialized to work properly
  (see snd_mididevice in i_music.cpp), either make sure the callback only
  does its thing once the stuff it needs has been initialized, or don't
  create any instances of the cvar until the initialization has finished.

June 17, 1999
- Added flat scaling, manual panning, and rotation.
- Fixed a problem with PCD_UNARYMINUS. It was popping the result off the
  stack, so any calculations that used it were wrong and could potentially
  crash.

June 15, 1999
- Got the program to compile and link as C++ code. Some structs have been
  transformed into classes, and savegames are disabled until I can get
  serialization to work.

June 11, 1999
- Found an interesting problem with EV_StartLightFlickering. It takes two
  parameters describing the light levels, but they were completely ignored.
  Fixed.

June 7, 1999
- Changed R_FakeFlat to optionally not care about whether or not the camera's
  current sector is also in a sector referenced by a Transfer_Heights special.
- Changed all numspechit loops in the code to test against (numspechit > 0)
  instead of (numspechit--).
- Changed Thing_Projectile(Gravity) so that it should work properly with any
  non-missiles.
- Fixed a bug in P_NightmareRespawn caused by mindlessly cutting-and-pasting
  from P_SpawnMapThing.
- Found a bug in the translation of BOOM generalized floors/ceilings. One
  of my bit shifts was off by one. Also fixed the code in zwadconv.
- Changed the boss brain's height back to 16 for compatibility with
  Strain MAP20.
- A few days ago, I tried sorting the edges of polyobjects at runtime to
  support concave polys at any rotation. It didn't work. I'll probably
  have to use a span buffer.
- Stuck in my new span drawer. I actually wrote it about two months ago.
  Now it's finally going to be in a release version of ZDoom. It's about
  6 fps (~23%) faster at 1024x768. Also removed ds_colshift (because it is
  no longer used) and the unrolled span drawer in linear.nas.
- The turbo cvar's callback wasn't being called when it was set. Fixed.
- This a huge gap between log entries. Sorry, but I've been too lazy to
  write anything here.

March 15, 1999
- Added support for custom ambient sound attenuations. This is an optional
  floating point value that follows the point keyword.
- For 1.17, I had changed the sound volumes in s_sound.c to floats
  *except* for the ambient sounds which were still being treated as byte
  values between 0-255, so they would always play at full volume. Fixed.

March 14, 1999
- Discovered a savegame bug: An mobj's translation table was being saved
  improperly and could point to invalid memory on reload. Fixed.
- Added another dmflag, DF_RESPAWN_SUPER, to cause invulnerability and
  invisibility to respawn. No room in menu, so you have to set it by hand.
- Added an alwaysapplydmflags cvar that can be used to cause dmflags that
  normally only affect deathmatch to apply to single player and coop games
  as well.
- Changed P_Thing_Spawn() so that it can spawns things anywhere and not
  just at map spots. (Useful for making it look like a monster was carrying
  an item.)
- Added support for MBF's sky texture transfer linedefs. Also added support
  for Hexen's Sky2 sector special.
- In r_plane.c, spanstop was never used anywhere. Removed it.

March 10, 1999
- Made the network code "better." htons is used in the appropriate places,
  and the port a packet is sent from is used to determine which node sent
  a packet (so now I can test more than two-player games on my machine).
- Added an event-driven timer routine. Instead of busy waiting for a new tic,
  I can wait on an event and give other processes some CPU time. This makes
  two-player games on one machine run much more smoothly on Windows 95/98.
  (It was already smooth for the foreground player on NT.)

March 8, 1999
- Fixed a problem with R_DrawPSprite. It was leaving vis->translucency unset,
  which could produce odd results depending on the contents of the stack.

March 7, 1999
- Discovered a big problem with my linked list of ceiling_t's implementation.
  Fixed.

March 6, 1999
- Added two new screen wipes: burn and crossfade.
- The mid-screen message gets cleared out on level load now.
- Stopped using the zone heap to store level snapshots.
- Enhanced the stealth monsters so that they will take advantage of all
  translucency levels available.
- Fixed the damage for A_MonsterRail. I guess DOOM doesn't copy the damage
  amount out of the mobjinfo when an mobj is spawned.
- Added a check to the fullscreen HUD to prevent it from going outside the
  array of armor pictures if the AC was above 2.
- The DeHackEd code was setting the Blue AC for max soulsphere health. Fixed.
- Tried out Rick Clark's toxplant.wad and discovered a bug with the
  particles: They were colored by whichever sector was drawn last and not
  the sector they were in. Fixed.
- Pulled the old info.h from the 1.17a source so I could get things in a
  working state to put up a fixed DeHackEd version for the Ground Zero TC.

March 4, 1999
- Word of advice: When you have 2847 states and 399 mobjinfos (from Hexen)
  to reformat, don't try to do it all by hand. I was smart enough to use a
  program to convert all the states into the multigen format, but I thought
  I could handle the mobjs myself. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! After a few hours,
  my arm was aching, and I had only done about one fourth of the mobjinfos.
  Then I wrote a program to convert the ones from Hexen's info.c into
  multigen format, and all I had to do was drag them to the correct place
  with my mouse. Much easier, and much less strenuous. (Also much less
  error-prone.)

  For comparison, Heretic has 161 mobjinfos and 1205 states.
  Doom 2 has a mere 137 mobjinfos and 967 states.

March 3, 1999
- Had a change of plans about how I want to implement multiple games in a
  single executable. All the data in info.c and info.h will be moved to an
  external data file whose format is based on that used by multigen (the
  tool id used to generate info.c). The list of spawnable things will also
  be moved out of p_things.c and into this file.
  
  This means that everything I did in info.h on March 1 was wasted. Oh well.

March 1, 1999
- Pasted labels for the Heretic and Hexen things into info.c. Had to
  shuffle a few of them around:

  --- Things renamed ---
	MT_MISC* -> MT_DMISC* (if Doom)
				MT_HMISC* (if Heretic)
				MT_XMISC* (if Hexen)
	MT_BARREL -> MT_HBARREL (for Heretic)
				 MT_DBARREL (for Doom)
	MT_TFOG -> MT_DTFOG, MT_HTFOG, MT_XTFOG
			   created a new MT_TFOG elsewhere. the others should be
			   copied on top of it as appropriate.
	MT_HEAD -> renamed Doom's to MT_CACODEMON
	MT_KNIGHT -> renamed Doom's to MT_HELLKNIGHT
	MT_FIREBOMB -> MT_HFIREBOMB, MT_XFIREBOMB

  --- Things moved into common Heretic/Hexen section ---
	MT_ARTIFLY
	MT_ARTIINVULNERABILITY -> ditto
	MT_ARTIEGG -> ditto
	MT_EGGFX -> ditto
	MT_ARTISUPERHEAL -> ditto
	MT_ARTITELEPORT -> ditto
	MT_SPLASH
	MT_SPLASHBASE
	MT_LAVASPLASH
	MT_LAVASMAKE
	MT_SLUDGECHUNK
	MT_SLUDGESPLASH
	MT_BLOODSPLATTER
	MT_BLOODYSKULL
	MT_MNTRFX1
	MT_MNTRFX2 (deathsound is sfx_phohit in Heretic, no sound in Hexen)
	MT_MNTRFX3
	MT_SOUNDWATERFALL

  --- Things moved to global section ---
	MT_BLOOD (note that Hexen's blood has mass 5, not 100. was #38)
	MT_TELEPORTMAN (was #41)
	MT_PLAYER (was #0) Hexen's is name differently, so it didn't move.

	(Hexen things renamed)
	MT_MINOTAUR -> MT_MAULATOR
	MT_SOUNDWIND -> MT_XSOUNDWIND

- Added a pulsating effect for the invisibility powerup that slowly
  "pulses" it in and out of visibility, but never going below 25%, so it's
  never totally invisible.
- Spent a few hours with the DOSDoom translucency code. I think the
  greenness of it is probably more the fault of DOOM's limited palette,
  particularly after comparing the 25% translucency table from before
  with 25% translucency now. Very low levels of translucency with one
  of the colors being dark are still too green, though.

February 28, 1999
- Added DOSDoom 0.65's translucency code. I'm not sure if it was really
  worth it, though. I tried Allegro's RGB table code to speed up the
  generation of the translucency table, but it didn't seem to produce
  very satisfactory results, so I use BestColor to find palette colors
  to use. The results are satisfactory, but they seem a bit too green.
- Delayed gathering of data on a sprite's patches (width, topoffset, and
  offset) until it is needed (either when the level is precached, or when
  the sprite is first seen). Game startup is a great deal quicker without
  any noticable performance hit elsewhere. Cool.

February 27, 1999
- Note: Hexen's friction is roughly equivalent to a Sector_SetFriction of
  171 (ends up as 0xf909, Hexen uses 0xf900). Player movement thrust should
  be halved at this level. Changed the calculation of sector->movefactor
  accordingly. (With the BOOM code, player thrust was nearly one fourth
  normal with that level of friction.)
- Discovered that MBF's code to affect monsters with friction doesn't
  work without the change it made to how mobjs are linked into the blockmap.

February 24, 1999
- Stopped using stdio in w_wad.c.
- Had left some calls to W_Profile in W_InitMultipleFiles(). Removed.

February 21, 1999
- Added support for real looping sounds, because Herian 2 used so many of
  them, and the old method sounded pretty bad with them.
- Found a problem with sliding polyobj doors: If, when they try to close,
  they can't move anywhere from their open position, they would move
  slightly further open and leave a gap when they managed to close. Fixed.
- Added support for auto-loading of skins if they're in a skins directory
  in the same directory as the executable.
- Added support for C-style formatting codes to ACS print statements.
- Fixed a problem where, when a player turns into a pile of bloody gibs
  (from e.g. a crushing ceiling), they would assume their standing position.
  This is because the gibs are a different sprite, and I wasn't letting
  player mobjs change their sprite.
- Fixed ceilings so that they stop making noise when they get put in stasis.
- PIT_ChangeSector() can spawn particle blood now.
- Fixed R_DrawSplash2() so that it doesn't draw all the particles to the
  left of the impact point.
- Added an A_MonsterRail function so monsters can shoot a railgun too.
- Fixed the railgun sound when you're not the one shooting it. My algorithm
  for finding the closest point on the line was wrong and still should
  remnants from when I was calculating the distance from the line.
- Fixed some player bobbing problems.

February 20, 1999
- Changed sparks to play with static attenuation.
- Found out why pickup messages would sometimes seemingly print several
  times for a single item. Some maps have several of the same item on top
  of each other so that a player can get more than they would normally
  without even realizing it. I get around this by disallowing two identical
  pickup messages from being printed back-to-back in a single tic.
- Fixed transsouls. I wasn't calling its callback at initialization, so it
  wouldn't take effect until the next time it was changed at the console.
- Recompiled PTC with DDFLIP_WAIT enabled. I had accidentally left it off
  from my testing run on January 8.
- Dug up the DirectDraw code from 1.12 and used it to add DirectDraw support
  back into the game. Now even people who can't get PTC to work should be
  able to use it.
  One interesting thing I noticed is that IDirectDrawSurface's Blt method
  is horribly slow for blitting between system and video memory. I tried it,
  thinking it would be optimized, but it wasn't even close.
- Added the A_Die, A_Detonate, and A_Mushroom routines from MBF.
- Removed the screens array and replaced it with a single variable named
  (oddly enough) screen.
- Added a V_SetBlend() to F_StartFinale() to get rid of any palette flashes
  that might have been on screen (such as after finishing E1M8).
- Discovered the real reason why the brain shooter wasn't working. DOOM
  doesn't explode noclip missiles when they go above the ceiling or below
  the floor; it just adjusts their positions. Hexen doesn't have that check
  for noclip, so it will explode/remove it. I guess I didn't check MAP30
  after adding Hexen's z-checking.

February 19, 1999
- Finally got around to fixing V_DrawPatchFlipped(). Wow, that was easy. I
  wonder why I was having so much trouble with it the last time I touched it
  many months ago.
- Changed the item pickup sounds to play with a NULL entity for the local
  player (like before), but still play on CHAN_ITEM for other players.
- Fixed the problem of monster names not being drawn in the cast finale: I
  was still xoring each character with 0x80 to make it red under the old
  text system.
- Changed the keyboard code so that the keypad isn't translated into number
  keys in full console mode with the menu active.
- Fixed the Read This! sequence of menus in Ultimate Doom. When it's
  finished, it's supposed to re-enable the skull and empty the stack.
- Fixed a problem with raise doors. In Doom, you can close them prematurely
  by activating them again. I had the right idea:
		if (GET_SPAC(line->flags) == SPAC_PUSH)
  but it should have been
		if (GET_SPAC(line->flags) != SPAC_PUSH)

February 18, 1999
- Release 1.17 again, hopefully this time for good.
- Fixed some problems that were already found with 1.17:
  * The cubes spawned by the boss on DOOM2/MAP30 would be in the ceiling and
    disappear right away. (All I can say is that it worked before; I don't
	know why it stopped.)
  * Because of my quick hack for voodoo doll obituaries, getting killed by
    the world would crash.
  * Open scripts above 255 wouldn't properly restart when the level
    reloaded because the game thought they were still running.

February 17, 1999
- Made a final "final" compile of 1.17.
- Removed the hack that could transform normal exits into Teleport_NewMaps
  during the level translation process.
- Realized I had forgotten to do the following, so I did them:
  * Support the MF_TRANSLATION bits for DeHackEd patches that use them.
  * Add a TRANSLUC75 .bex mnemonic for symmetry.
  * Add a defaultmap entry for MAPINFO lumps.
  * Make r_columnmethod 1 the default.
  * Add a neverswitchonpickup cvar.
  * Extralight and fullbright need to be ignored in foggy areas.

February 16, 1999
- Did a final compile for 1.17 under both DOS and Win32. This will be the
  first release where I release versions for both operating systems
  simultaneously. Eventually, I'll have to abandon DOS if I want to keep
  progressing, but for now it's nice to be able to do this.
- Removed the limit on the number of sound sequences that can be loaded.
  There's still a limit on the number of translation slots, and I think
  it's good to leave it that way.
- Added a menu stack, so that pressing escape to back out of a menu only
  backs up through the menus the user has visited.
- Tried adding some code to djgpp/i_video.cpp so that it could write
  directly to VGA memory. Then I found out that regular VGA mode 13h
  doesn't support page flipping, so I took it out.

February 14, 1999
- Added some #ifdef's to i_sound.c so that it works equally well with
  both VC++ and DJGPP.
- Added support for Hexen's parallax skies. I'm not sure why I thought
  the front one was a normal masked texture. (It uses color 0 to indicate
  transparency instead.) I also removed R_DrawMaskedSky() and added the
  restriction that both sky textures must be the same height.

February 13, 1999
- Tried boomedit.wad, and it turns out I was wrong about ML_PASSUSE. Non-
  use lines could and did eat uses. Changed it so that only SPAC_USE
  does now.
- Moved the functionality of the ML_PASSUSE flag into a new activation
  type: SPAC_USETHROUGH. The flag was only applicable to use activation
  lines, so it seemed sensely to have it wasting a bit for all other
  types. Now I have a free linedef flag if I need it.
- Removed the hack to allow players to move if they were currently stuck.
  With it in, polyobjects could push players through walls, which is even
  more undesirable. Since I'm now using MBF's momentum code (which, like
  Doom's but not Boom's, allows players to build up enough momentum to
  escape from walls if they're trivially inside them), I don't really need
  the "fix" anyway.
- Added a revert argument to the ChangeCamera special that causes the camera
  to move back inside the player's head if he moves.
- Added a SetPlayerProperty special.
- Created things for the particle fountains and sparks.
- Created sound sequences for the appropriate Doom sector movements. I also
  had to expand on the language as defined by Hexen a bit.
- Replaced my floor waggling code with Hexen's, so now it's right.
- Added three new level flags:
	* evenlighting
	* noautosequences
	* forcenoskystretch
- Added a progress indicator for the translucency table building process.

February 12, 1999
- Removed the round-robin assignment of virtual channels in i_sound.c. Since
  we're no longer letting MIDAS pick the sfx channels for us, this is
  pointless (and potentially hazard-prone if many sounds are being played
  very frequently).
- Added support for sound sequences, so now the polyobjects aren't silent
  when they move.

February 11, 1999
- Added "support" for 0-length sounds. (Meaning they get replaced by dsempty
  instead of crashing when malloc tries to alloc 4 gigs for them.)

February 10, 1999
- Adopted Hexen's script parsing code (sc_man.c). It lends itself toward
  much cleaner script handling code. [no association with ACS]

February 7, 1999
- Incorporated MBF's friction code in place of BOOM's. (Incidentally, I also
  discovered that I had left out some of BOOM's. No matter now.)
- Added a hack to P_XYMovement() so that players will still be able to move
  if they get stuck inside a line or another thing.

February 6, 1999
- Played some deathmatch with gothicdm2 and noticed two problems:
    * On rare occasions, I would spawn and be stuck.
	* Weapon pickup messages would sometimes print more than once. (Was I
	  picking them up more than once when I ran over them? Not sure.)
	* Once when the other player died, he didn't turn into a corpse.
- Added the ability to activate scripts by picking up items.
- Changed the polyobject functions called from p_lnspec.c so that they take
  individual paremeters rather than a byte array of args.
- Demos can now be played from disk without first loading them with the
  -file parameter.
- The automap will now follow the console player's camera rather than the
  console player himself.
- Added a notice warning that a demo will go out of sync if it was recorded
  with a different version of the game.
- Added playdemo and timedemo commands.
- Added colored text support and different message levels. This was
  planned for several months, and now I've finally written the code for it.

February 4, 1999
- Modified C_AddNotifyString() so that it properly supports lines
  ending with '\r' or '\n' instead of assuming that they all end with
  '\n' and starting each on a new line.
- Fixed a problem with PTR_CameraTraverse() that could position the
  chasecam inside a two-sided wall.
- Removed the handling for ANIM_RANDOM from wi_stuff.c since it wasn't
  used anywhere.

February 3, 1999
- Removed the use of screens[1] in wi_stuff.c by allocating a new screen
  just big enough to hold the background image and then blitting that to
  the screen each frame.
- Changed the demo loop a bit so that it will automatically try to play
  any number of demos beginning with DEMO1 and continuing up in sequence.
  (Of course, since I removed the ability to play old-style demos, it's
  only of use for wads that provide their own demos.)
- Did a bunch of miscellaneous cleanup from the Hexen source.
- Fixed player extreme deaths playing "*gibbed" instead of "*xdeath1".
- When a player leaves a network game, their body is now removed.
- Removed the check against monsters crossing secret lines. They *can*
  cross secret lines and activate them, they just don't use/push secret
  lines.

January 31, 1999
- Linedef type 134 was being improperly translated to require a blue key.
  It should have been red.
- Fixed a round-off problem in P_ZMovement() that could cause the player's
  landing sound to play when the player wasn't falling fast enough. For
  some reason, converting the floating point minimum momz to an it was
  subtracting one (even though it was already integral). So, for normal
  gravity, it was comparing the player's z momentum against -524287
  instead of -524288.
- Fixed a crash bug in M_LoadDefaults() when migrating from a pre-1.14
  config file without any binding for F5.

January 30, 1999
- Added blood, gunshot, and grenade particle effects.

January 29, 1999
- Fixed up the handling of .bex thing mnemonics and added the names for
  the second set of flags (albeit, not many are actually implemented).

January 27, 1999
- Created a new traversal function for the rail gun.
- Finally figured out why so many lost souls spawned by pain elementals
  were getting stuck. I was spawning two lost souls in the same spot (where
  there should have been only one). Oops.
- Found a case where the sight-checking code could trace a line that missed
  its ending cell and continue off the edge of the map, thus crashing the
  game. Made some changes to compensate: When the ending column or row is
  reached, mapxstep or mapystep will be set to 0 to prevent it from
  traversing any further in that direction.
- Using spynext and spyprev now briefly display the name of the player
  you switched to.

January 25, 1999
- Added armor and keys to the fullscreen HUD.

January 24, 1999
- Imported Hexen's z-checking code in place of my own. Hopefully it will
  work better. Also added a few other Hexenism while I was at it, like
  bouncy objects.
- Sped up wipes on tall screens so they should be about the same speed as
  one 200 pixels tall.
- Fixed plats so that they properly rebound off the ceiling. I was
  checking if the plat's crush field was non-zero when I should have been
  checking that it wasn't -1.
- Made some more improvements to D_ErrorLoop().
- Fixed some problems with the lighting with different r_detail values.
- columnofs[] was being constructed wrong for horizontally stretched
  detailed modes (too far to the right). Fixed.
- Added some unrolled drawers based off the Hexen source for 320x200
  and 320x240. I don't expect anything but a 386/486 to benefit from them.

January 23, 1999
- Fixed the light-amp so that it doesn't turn off colored lighting.
- Added positional sounds. Now that I have them, I also removed the
  temporary switch mobj that was used to provide a place to play the
  switch sounds.
- During demo playback, the chase command will now let you switch to
  and from the chasecam, so chasedemo isn't really needed unless you want
  to start the demo in chasecam mode.
- Added the player's score to the fullscreen HUD in deathmatch.
- Fixed the spynext/spyprev commands so that they properly update the
  status bar when you switch to another player. Also fixed it so the
  camera doesn't stay in a dead player's corpse if you're not watching
  the person who recorded the demo.
- Fixed the alignment of the scores display at high resolutions and also
  added a level countdown timer if timelimit is in effect (ala Lithium).
- Removed Hexen's solution for getting the player to produce more than
  one sound and adopted Quake's: each mobj has 8 channels with some of
  them set aside for predefined uses.

January 21, 1999
- Stopped using MIDAS's auto effect channels and started using the ones
  calculated by the game's own sound code. This seems to have fixed all
  the previous problems with sounds cutting out prematurely.

January 20, 1999
- Adjusted the WEAPONTOP #define in p_pspr.c so that the player sprites
  will meet the bottom of the screen at higher resolutions instead of
  leaving a gap.

January 17, 1999
- Added a chasedemo cvar. When it's true, the demo is played back in
  chasecam mode.
- Fixed a memory leak when the game had to generate a translucency table.
  (out was not being freed.)
- Stopped using Z_Malloc() for temporary compression buffers and switched
  to the libc functions. (libc has a bigger memory pool.)
- Fixed problem with skins that used sounds in the IWAD.
- Fixed a bug that could crash the game if something went amiss during
  the startup process but after setjmp() was called. Now D_ErrorLoop()
  explicitly enters the GS_FULLCONSOLE state before doing anything else.

January 16, 1999
- Added particle fountain effects with the following colors:
	red, green, blue, yellow, purple, black, and white
- Got rocket trails into a state I think looks nice.
- Improved the particle system further by making the particle sizes
  adjustable, letting particles fade out over time, and moving all of
  the particle thinking out of the renderer and into the play simulation.
- Imported some of Hexen's sound code to limit the total number of same
  sounds playing and also to allow players to make more than one noise
  at a time.
- Fixed the operation of FloorAndCeiling_(Raise/Lower)ByValue. Contrary
  to what the Hexen specs state, they do not multiply their height
  argument by 8.

January 14, 1999
- Switched to the p_sight.c of Hexen. This is benefitial for two reasons:
  1. It knows about polyobjects.
  2. It doesn't traverse the BSP tree. Yes, I know this means it's slower,
     but it also means I can use it with a portal engine, which doesn't
	 even have a BSP tree.
- Moved the locating of the polyobj spots out of PO_Init() and into
  P_SpawnMapThing().

January 12, 1999
- Added the polyobject stuff from Hexen.
- Copied Hexen's earthquake viewshifting code into R_SetupFrame().
- Changed P_Thing_Projectile() so that it can play a thing's sight sound
  and sets some other values properly.
- Added a delay to open and deferred scripts of one second after seeing
  that the Hexen code does it (and it's a good way of avoiding delays in
  open scripts to get past the screen wipe).
- Fixed a bug in P_StartScript() that would cause it to crash if someone
  tried to start a nonexistant script.

January 11, 1999
- Added an r_drawflat cvar to draw segs as flat colors instead of textures.
- In R_StoreWallRange(), changed the lighting calculation so that lines will
  have the same amount of light no matter what their orientation if a
  non-black fade is applied to them (otherwise the fog effect looks dumb).

January 10, 1999
- Added a rocket trail using the particle system.
- Added a particle system.
- Added support for PWADs like Gothic DM2 that used a hack to get sprites-in-
  a-pwad with regular Doom by making some changes to W_MergeLumps().

January 9, 1999
- Added a progress-meter to the console.
- Made a fix (submitted by John Cole) to the height-checking code so that if a
  player stands on another player, the player on the bottom doesn't get
  stuck.
- Changed P_GiveWeapon() to check if there are any graphics for a weapon. If
  there aren't, then it won't give the player the weapon. Also changed "give
  weapons" to call P_GiveWeapon() so that it won't give the player a weapon
  that doesn't exist in the current iwad (like the ssg with doom.wad).
- Fixed psprites so that the muzzleflash has the same visibility (fuzz) flags
  as the weapon sprite.
- Added the setting of YourColor when am_usecustomcolors is 0. It should have
  been there a long time ago.

January 8, 1999
- Since the new column rendering code is essentially done (unless I decide
  that it's actually worth the hassle to draw columns in bunches of 8--4 was
  enough bother), I took some timings with the new and old routines. These
  are for looking directly at a wall, the worst-case scenario for the old
  routines. I tried disabling vbl wait, but DirectDraw always seems to do it
  even when I don't tell it to, so the numbers for the low resolutions aren't
  very informative since they cap at the screen's refresh rate. Rates from
  two Build games under similar conditions are also given for comparison.
  This is on my PII-350:

	mode		old		new		Blood	Duke3D
	320x200		70		70		212		324
	320x240		60		60		174		274
	400x300		60		60		120		212
	480x360		60		60		91		147
	512x384		40		60		80		128
	640x400		32		64		60		96
	640x480		27		57		51		83
	800x600		27		42		34		51
	960x720		12		27		24		37
	1024x768	8		21		21		33
	1152x864	9		19		17		23
	1280x1024	6		15		12		17

  It looks like the new routines are about twice as fast as the old ones. It
  also looks like I can draw walls faster than Blood but not Duke. For
  rendering a real scene that consists of more than just a single wall, ZDoom
  beats them both, since a single wall is the best-case scenario for Build.
  Frame rates in ZDoom seem to be pretty even now, which is nice since the
  old routines were significantly slower at drawing walls than anything else.

- Put in a check in R_RenderSegLoop1() and R_RenderSegLoop2() for NULL
  walllights. Right after starting a level, it seems walllights isn't
  getting set properly, but it appears to work fine afterward. Hmm...
- Got back to school and had a chance to try the new routines on my machine
  and, wow! I can now do a steady 35 fps at 800x600. 960x720 hovers around
  27 fps. 1024x768 is around 20 fps. Not bad.

January 6, 1999
- Wrote a better assembly version of R_DrawColumnHoriz() with no partial
  register stalls and presumably no AGI stalls on regular Pentiums. If it's
  faster than the C code, it's not much faster. (At least it's not
  significantly slower, anyway.)

January 5, 1999
- Tried an assembly version of R_DrawColumnHoriz(). It was actually
  slower than the C code by about 8 fps. Probably because of all the
  partial register stalls. I guess they really can kill performance.
  Stupid Intel processors. :-)
- Continued work on the optimized column drawers so that they have
  analogues of all the regular column drawers and can also be used to
  draw sprites. On this P-II 300, 720x480 runs at a pretty consistent
  35 fps. 864x480 isn't much worse, either. (Yeah, weird modes, I know.)
  800x600 runs at about 25 fps. Not bad, considering that this is all
  C code.
- Added R_StretchColumn() and R_DrawTlatedLucentColumn() functions.

January 4, 1999
- Recompiled everything with __fastcall as the default parameter-passing
  convention. Is it better? Not sure, but the exe did shrink by 11k. I
  think the framerate may have risen by 0.5 fps, too.

January 3, 1999
- Added support for using RIFF WAVEs as sound lumps.

January 2, 1999
- Fixed EV_StopPlat() so that it doesn't get stuck looping on the first
  plat because I had forgot to advance scan inside the while loop.
- Fixed P_LineAttack() so that it can still spawn bullet puffs on the
  floor or ceiling even if the bullet path never hits a line within range.

January 1, 1999
- Worked some more with the cache optimized column drawers. Now they work
  for masked walls and skies as well as solid walls.

December 28, 1998
- Added some C code to do "interleaved column drawing" (the method that
  proved to be the fastest in my test two days ago). Wall drawing is about
  twice as fast at 1024x768. Lower resolutions show less, but still
  measurable, improvement. Hopefully converting it to assembly will
  result in a further speedup.
- Fixed problem with monsters continuing to attack their target even after
  they had killed it.
- Adjusted the minimum distance between the chasecam and a wall/floor/
  ceiling.

December 27, 1998
- Added a chasecam. Use the chase command to turn it on and off.

December 26, 1998
- Ran a simple texturing test drawing a 128-pixel tall texture into a
  1024x768 block using several different methods. The methods and
  average times for one pass of each method are:
  > drawing it directly to the buffer: 94.18 ms
  > drawing four columns into a temp array and then merging
    them into the buffer: 24.456 ms
  > interleaving four columns into a temp array and then copying them
    into the buffer as a series of longword writes: 24.338 ms
  > interleaving four columns into a temp array and then colormapping them
    as they get copied to the buffer: 21.71 ms

  using variations of the fourth method for translated columns:
  > translating during the copy to the buffer: 21.684 ms
  > translation during the mapping to the temp array: 24.29 ms

  using variations of the third and fourth method for translucent columns:
  > colormapping into the temp array: 31.75 ms
  > colormapping during the copy to the buffer: 30.42 ms

  using variations of the third and fourth method for translated,
  translucent columns:
  > translating into the temp array: 32.58 ms
  > translating during the copy to the buffer: 31.45 ms

  These tests give me an idea of what I need to do to improve the game's
  renderer.

- Added an extension to normal exit lines during translation so that if a
  map has a MAPINFO entry, then it gets translated to Teleport_NewMap
  instead of Exit_Normal. The levelnum is (tag % 1000) and position is
  (tag / 1000). Thus, you can create hubs with regular Doom maps provided
  that they have MAPINFO entries.
- The video drivers on this machine at home have a weird bug. Apparently at
  random, when the palette is changed, random colors will have their blue
  values set to the opposite of what they should be. I can't see any way to
  work around it. Ah well. It's not my machine anyway... :-)
- Fixed togglemap so that it does nothing if the player isn't in a level.
  (Could have crashed if used on the title screen.)

December 25, 1998
- Added Static_Init special (190) to handle BOOM-like control linedefs for
  setting sector properties (at the moment: color, fog, damage, and gravity)
  at level load time.

December 24, 1998
- Fixed a problem in G_CheckSpot() where a corpse would get moved vertically
  to check for collisions in a spawn spot, but then it wouldn't be restored
  to its original height after the check.
- Fixed a problem I had introduced in P_LookForPlayers(). I had been
  operating under the assumption that whenever it was called, actor->target
  was NULL. Thus, I thought that assigning actor->goal to actor->target was
  safe even if actor->goal was NULL. This isn't the case. In coop, this
  function can be called with a valid actor->target. Setting it to NULL can
  then play havoc with P_NewChaseDir(), which can get called immediately
  afterward in A_Chase(). Now it only sets actor->target to actor->goal if
  actor->target is already NULL.

December 22, 1998
- Fixed the thing spawners so that they don't spawn monsters if the
  nomonsters dmflag is set.
- Changed the imp fireball to be 75% opaque.
- Replaced the am_key?color cvars with am_lockedcolor. Finally rewrote the
  code in the automap that uses it, too. (Up until now, it was still using
  the old Doom specials to determine locked doors, even though they all get
  converted into Door_LockedRaise before the automap ever sees the line.

December 21, 1998
- Added ML_BLOCKEVERYTHING linedef flag.

December 20, 1998
- Added support for a ChangeCamera special.

December 19, 1998
- Added a fire effect to the player setup menu (which I had wanted to do
  ever since I saw Unreal).

December 15, 1998
- Went through commands.txt, and documented new commands and cvars (and also
  some that I had missed from 1.14). I still count 4 undocumented commands,
  but I can't figure out what they are even when I compare it with the output
  of the cmdlist command.
- Fixed problem with V_BreakLines() not properly setting the pixels width
  of lines that were broken.
- Fixed problem of Plat_UpByValue not going back down.

December 13, 1998
- Fixed problem of lighting in hires modes lightening too quickly.
- Added outsidefog key to MAPINFO lump parser to set the fog color for
  any sectors with sky ceilings.
- Removed the translucency on health bonuses.
- Improved some of the error-handling code in the midi playback routines,
  and the problem seems to have gone away.

December 12, 1998
- Started experiencing a strange midi problem: it works with the debug
  build but not the release.
- Added soundlist command to display the assignment of sounds.
- Added dynamic sound linking so that sounds that refer to the same lump
  use the same copy of the sound. Added the soundlinks command to view
  the linking of sounds.
- Fixed problem of punching someone to death being treated as an
  unknown means of death in the obituaries.
- Spawning players now telefrag things standing at their spawnpoint, so
  it's no longer possible to get stuck inside another player when
  spawning. Also relaxed the restriction on deathmatch starts so that
  only one is needed to start a game.
- Added nobfgaim cvar to disable freeaiming of the bfg. (suggested by
  Tony Fabris)
- Was trying to figure out why weapnext and weapprev only worked for
  player 0 in network games, when they suddenly started working.
  Hopefully it's permanent... [Now that I've thought about it a little
  more, I probably just wasn't getting the mouse captured when I alt-tabbed
  to the other player's window.]
- Rewrote weapnext and weapprev commands to use the inventory "system."
- Added a dir command.
- Added support for the second joystick device because my joystick somehow
  got assigned to it (and made me aware that it exists :-). Also added
  joy_xthreshold, joy_ythreshold, joy_xsensitivity, joy_ysensitivity, and
  joy_speedmultiplier cvars.
- Added support for double bindings (for double clicking, but it works with
  all keys, not just the mouse buttons) to C_DoKey() and some associated
  console commands.
- Changed C_DoKey() so that it takes an event as input.
- Added some code to PTR_ShootTraverse so that bullet puffs can appear on
  floors and ceilings.

December 6, 1998
- Fixed problem of monsters being slow to attack a player if they were
  on a route: Their reactiontime was too high.
- Added a gender option to the player setup menu.
- If getsfx() tries to load a sexed sound, and it doesn't exist, it will
  try to load a male version of the sound.
- Added an empty sound (dsempty).
- Changed sound handling slightly so that sounds are now loaded when
  they are first used instead of during I_InitSound(). They still stick
  around forever after that.
- Changed the names of every sound in SNDINFO. It's no longer Hexen-
  compatible, but it should at least be compatible with what I want to
  do eventually. I also redid the way skin sounds are handled to better
  fit my new sound naming conventions: Any gender/skin-specific sounds
  can be used by prefacing them with a '*' and passing a player mobj to
  a sound function. (If a player mobj is not passed, it defaults to male).
- Fixed the problem of button sounds being played in the wrong place
  when they're deactivated. For some reason, I had this line in
  P_UpdateSpecials():
		S_StartSound ((mobj_t *)&button->soundorg, "Switch1", 78);
  but button->soundorg is an mobj_t *. I'm surprised it didn't crash.
- Changed P_Thing_Spawn() and P_Thing_Projectile() so that they will only
  spawn things at map spots and not just anything with a matching tid.
- Fixed P_Thing_Projectile() so that it will still spawn missiles even if
  there is something at their spawn spot.

December 4, 1998
- Was playing a dark level and noticed that the fog isn't "thick"
  enough at higher resolutions: It transitions from darkness to fullbright
  far too quickly.
- Tweaked the falling damage some more using some code from Q2.
- Rearranged the startup sequence slightly so that I_Init() gets called
  before I_InitGraphics() (like it was before).
- Added support for gendered death messages.
- Rewrote portions of d_dehack.c so that it takes less space when compiled
  and also added .bex support. (Tried it with a few .bex files, but didn't
  do any extensive testing. Assuming it works. :-)
- Added a check in Printf() to avoid drawing to the console too rapidly
  during startup, because that can slow it down.
- Changed P_LoadSegs so that it clears a line's ML_TWOSIDED flag if an
  associated sidedef doesn't point to a back sector (otherwise the game
  could crash in p_sight.c when the line came into view).
- Removed foreign language "support." It's been broken for a while and was
  too hard to add new strings.
- Moved string names out of d_dehack.c and into dstrings.c (which is where
  they should have been in the first place.)

November 30, 1998
- Had a flash of insight for how I could speed up the rendering of walls. A
  quick test shows that filling the screen with columns of shorts is about
  twice as fast as filling it with columns of bytes. If I draw wall columns
  into memory in consecutive bytes, and then copy them to the screen in
  another pass, I should be able to combine the writing of two or more
  columns together, obtaining a speed boost that should, at the very least,
  let me maintain 35 fps at 800x600 on my machine. I'll have to try it and
  see if it actually works in practice. The overhead of writing the walls
  twice might kill any performance boost this could offer. On 486s and slow
  Pentiums, this will almost certainly be more of a hinderance than a help,
  and it's not needed at low resolutions anyway, so I plan on keeping it
  optional if it turns out to be benefitial.

November 29, 1998
- Tested a theory, and I was right. :-( Drawing vertical columns is
  inherantly slower than drawing horizontal spans, probably because drawing
  them vertically results in a whole lot more cache misses. What I did to
  test it was replace most of D_Display() with a loop that filled the screen
  a solid color. At 800x600, filling the screen by columns was no faster than
  if I textured the walls (23 fps). Filling by rows, I could get 35 fps.
  Apparently, any further optimizations in the renderer will have to focus
  on drawing walls by rows instead of colums.

November 28, 1998
- Did some slight performance tuning in R_RenderSegLoop() by making more
  variables local to only certain blocks in the function. In 800x600,
  looking straight at a wall now gives ~23 fps vs ~20 fps before. (I really
  wasn't expecting such a marked improvement. It might be worthwhile to try
  and tweak this in assembly.)
- Pulled some blending addition code from the Q2 DLL. I had been trying to
  do the same thing myself, but couldn't quite manage it until I found
  id's code.

November 26, 1998
- Added support for cancelling messagemode by pressing escape.
- On the automap, a player with invulnerability is drawn with a color
  slightly off from the background rather than being hard-coded to palette
  entry 246 (which is almost black with the normal Doom palette).
- Finally got around to working out the bugs in teamplay. (Missiles would
  still hurt you even with friendly fire on.)
- Disabled intermission texts in deathmatch.
- Pretty sure I got a non-fatal version of I_Error working now. It uses
  setjmp() and longjmp() to do its magic.
- Removed the check for -statcopy in d_main.c.
- Removed the system menu from the ZDoom window. Unfortunately, this also
  means it doesn't get a minimize box. Oh well.
- Removed the restriction on using messagemode only during a netgame.
- Added mouse wheel support. Under Win95, it ought to work with DirectInput.
  Under NT 4.0 and 98, it should always works.

November 23, 1998
- Changed the startup code so that the graphics mode is initialized as early
  as possible, allowing us to use the in-game console for most startup text.
- Moved all the functionality of I_StartGraphics() into I_InitGraphics()
  because the game starts up in a fullscreen console now.
- Added endgame to quit out of a game and drop to the fullscreen console.
- Removed the ormask parameter from V_PrintStr() and V_PrintStr2(). It was
  almost never used, and in those cases where it was, it was easy enough to
  just or the string beforehand.
- Adjusted the colors of the CONCHARS lumps and changed a few special
  characters. With the fullscreen console, it was obvious that they were
  all too dark.
- Added a fullscreen console.
- Changed handling of WM_DESTROY messages in i_input.c to call exit()
  directly, because the WM_QUIT message didn't seem to be making its way
  into the message stream.
- Removed some unused #defines from doomdef.h
- Removed the store demo check from D_ProcessEvents().

November 22, 1998
- Fixed saving of monster goals (was referencing the tracer field instead).
- Made one-sided lines pushable.
- Made P_PushSpecialLine aware of the side of the line that was pushed.
- Moved the execution of deferred scripts out of P_StartOpenScripts so
  that going to a level with a saved snapshot would not terminate the
  script prematurely when the snapshot was loaded.

November 21, 1998
- Teleport_EndGame and Teleport_NewMap no longer execute if crossed
  along a linedef's back side.
- Discovered I had missed implementing Teleport_EndGame, so I added it.
- Fixed problem with level snapshots where plats and ceilings that were
  in stasis were saved incorrectly.

November 15, 1998
- Just tried listening to D_RUNNIN after a clean boot, and it didn't work
  the first time. :-( At least it plays properly after I use iwinit now...

November 14, 1998
- Bumped the height of the three small torches up from 34 to 37 units so
  that the player can't jump on top of them.
- Tweaked the thing auto step up in PIT_CheckThing some more so that it
  will only do the auto step up if you're not in the air. It seemed funny
  to be able to jump on top of most monsters. Never mind. I can't seem to
  get it to work only when I'm not jumping. :-(
- Added code to mus2strm.c so that it generates a tempo event at the
  beginning of the song. (The tempo used appears to be the default for
  midiStreamOpen, but I felt like being safe anyway.) AddEventToStream() in
  mid2strm.c also keeps track of all instruments used in a song now. This
  way I can get around what appears to be a bug in the GUS PnP drivers
  that would cause it not to play some instruments if they weren't already
  loaded in the card's RAM. Just before I start playing the actual song, I
  play each instrument very briefly and very quietly to get the instruments
  into the card's RAM.

November 2, 1998
- Added snd_mididevice cvar to allow the user to select which MIDI device
  to use and a snd_listmididevices cvar to enumerate the available devices.
- Added MIDI volume cvar snd_midivolume and a corresponding menu item.
- Finished mus2strm.c and made a few cleanups to the MIDI streaming code.
  Now I just need to switch to MikMod, and I won't have to use temporary
  files anywhere. (MIDAS can only load MODs from disk and not from memory.)

November 1, 1998
- Started cleaning up qmus2mid.c and transforming it into mus2strm.c.

October 31, 1998
- Took the mid2strm sample from the dx5sdk and used it to redo my MIDI
  support so that I can use the MIDI stream API now, the primary benefit
  being that it lets me set the MIDI volume for just that stream and not the
  entire system.
- Changed I_DetectOS() so that it doesn't identify Windows 98 as Windows 95.

October 24, 1998
- Discovered the blockmap generation wasn't actually working. Can't figure
  out why, since the same code works just fine in BOOM...
- Incorporated several of the changes from BOOM 2.02 such as "loose files",
  fire trail elimination, and automatic blockmap generation for large maps.

October 17, 1998
- Implemented the Radius_Quake line special.
- Removed limit on the size of recordable demos.
- Changed P_SpawnPlayer() so that it always spawns players on the ground.
- Created an MT_TELEPORTMAN2 that can be used to teleport things to points
  above the ground and fixed MT_TELEPORTMAN so that it teleports things onto
  the ground.
- Updated the teleport code so that it finds destinations using P_FindGoal()
  instead of searching through all the active thinkers.
- Fixed a memory allocation problem with the -iwad parameter.

October 16, 1998
- Rewrote IdentifyVersion() so that it identifies IWADs by their contents
  instead of their names. (except for tnt.wad and plutonia.wad, since I
  don't know of any other way to distinguish them from doom2.wad)
- Doors that needed yellow skull keys to be opened said they needed yellow
  cards instead. Fixed.
- Finally added proper support for substituting translucency for the fuzz
  effect. Instead of using a NULL colormap to represent fuzz, it takes
  advantage of the vissprite's flags field and sets MF_SHADOW. Then the
  colormap points to the colormap that would be used if the sprite wasn't
  shadow, so that it can be properly shaded when r_drawfuzz is 0.
- Got the colormaps code working. I just wasn't allocating enough space for
  the realcolormaps array. Oopsy.

October 15, 1998
- Decided to support changing of colormaps via Boom's 242 linedef after all
  instead of just changing the blend, so I started adding some code to
  support that. Unfortunately, now it doesn't work without any C_START/C_END
  colormaps. :-( Will fix tomorrow.

October 14, 1998
- Added a callback for the splashfactor cvar that prevents it from being
  set to illegal non-positive values and also computes the inverse of the
  cvar for scaling of the thrust felt by things that chew on their own
  missiles. That way, a player will always rocket jump the same height no
  matter what their splashfactor is set to.
- Fixed a problem with continuous sounds that prevented them from being
  played. When I had consolidated to using a single mobj thinker for all
  sounds instead of splitting them up as I had previously, I was erroneously
  setting the activation time for continuous sounds to 0 because I wanted
  their thinkers to get called right away. But the mobj thinker decrements
  the tic counter and *then* compares it with 0, so it would decrement the
  0, see -1, and then never doing anything with that mobj again.

October 10, 1998
- The button list gets saved in level snapshots now.
- Added full support for activation types of projectile cross, projectile
  hit, and push. Also added support for a few linedef types to be
  monster-activatable depending on their activation type even if
  ML_MONSTERSCANACTIVATE is not set. (So that, e.g. a monster can still
  open a local door of type Door_Raise without the level designer
  having to do anything special.)
- Removed the MAXBUTTONS limit and also fixed a problem with the sound
  origin used when activating switches/buttons.
- Changed the error messages in V_DrawWrapper() and V_DrawSWrapper() to
  use DPrintf() instead of Printf().
- Fixed problem with invulnerability I introduced yesterday. (Walls were
  still being drawn with the normal colormap.)

October 9, 1998
- Spent about an hour changing the rendering code so that each sector can
  have its own colormap. The light tables are now indices into a colormap
  rather than pointers into one. Spent about half an hour afterward
  figuring out why it seemed to be merging visplanes that were alike in
  everyway except for colormap. All in all, it was easier than I had
  expected. Unfortunately, it's also too slow to build a colormap in the
  middle of gameplay, so I guess an open script will have to be used to
  build any colormaps before the level starts if anyone wants to change a
  sector's color on the fly.

Ocober 8, 1998
- I had earlier changed PIT_RadiusAttack() to do only half damage to targets
  that originated the explosion, so that rocket jumping didn't hurt so much.
  The scale factor has now been moved into the cvar splashfactor and
  defaults to 1.0. The former behavior can be restored by setting it to 0.5.

October 5, 1998
- Spent about 15 minutes writing a routine to build a colormap for non-
  white lights. Tested it using an orange light for the entire level. It
  worked nicely, so now I just need to make it possible to set the light
  color on a sector-by-sector basis.
- Issue: Teleport destinations need to be flush with the floor instead of
  remembering the position they are spawned at. Discovered this while
  playing MAP20. A teleport destination lowers a great distance the first
  time you land on it. Going on it again will teleport you to its original
  height, and you fall from there. Maybe another type for destinations that
  remember their height, then?

October 4, 1998
- Added say_team and messagemode2 commands and team and teamplay cvars.
- Externalized the obituary messages and added a "Strings" section to the
  dehacked code. Since I'm pretty sure I'll be switching to scripted code
  ala Quake, this is only temporary (along with everything else dehacked).
- Added support for showing both skull and card keys in the status bar
  ala Boom.
- Added Sector_SetDamage and Sector_SetGravity line specials.
- Added another mobj flag (MF2_NOADJUST) so that you can walk on floating
  bridges without worrying about them getting bumped up above your head.
- Adjused PIT_CheckThing() so that it allows stepping up on top of things
  if their tops are no more than 24 units above the thing moving.

October 3, 1998
- Added an MT_AMBIENT mobj (doomed #14065). Its first argument determines
  which ambient sound it represents. (And is valid in the range 0-255.) It
  also subsumes the earlier MT_AMBIENT0 - MT_AMBIENT63 mobjs (doomed
  #14001 - 14064), and P_SpawnMapThing translates them into an
  instance of MT_AMBIENT. Also merged the world ambient thinker into the
  mobj thinker so that all ambient sounds are controlled with a single
  thinker function and not two.
- Removed sounds.h. Everything necessary to use sounds is now found in
  s_sound.h
- Disabled the recognition of any display modes other than INDEX8 in
  i_video.cpp. I'm no longer sure high/true color is such a good thing.
  Without a major loss of performance, I can't see any way to avoid a
  huge memory loss with more than a few palettes in those modes. :-(
- Did some work with ARGB8888 modes: I_Blit can now blit from INDEX8 to
  ARGB8888 surfaces. The console font now gets drawn on ARGB8888 surfaces
  (pretty sure it was before, but it stopped working sometime).
- Fixed the cast drawer so that the names don't get squashed together in
  resolutions at least 640 pixels wide.
- Fixed bug where pressing a key with a menu active would move the cursor
  to a blank line if it wasn't assigned as a hotkey.
- Added support for actually seeing skins as well as setting them in the
  player setup menu.
- Fixed bug with player colors for players 5-8.

October 1, 1998
- Continued work with "skins." Everything works now except actually
  seeing them.
- Did away with the spriteoffset[], spritewidth[], and spritetopoffset[]
  arrays and moved their contents into the sprite frame structure.

September 30, 1998
- Started work on supporting Doom Legacy "skins." (Personally, I think
  skin is a misnomer, but I'm afraid the term's probably here to stay.)
- Removed the maskdraw_t structure from r_things.c since it wasn't used
  anywhere. Here it is preserved for history:
	typedef struct {
		int x1, x2;
		int column;
		int topclip, bottomclip;
	} maskdraw_t;
  Wonder what it was for.

September 27, 1998
- Fixed long-standing bug in R_DrawSprite that could cause sprites to be
  drawn through the floor of a cliff if you look down just the right amount
  (when the top edge of the floor is exactly two pixels above the top of
  the screen).
- Added hacked-in support for colormaps with the Transfer_LightsHeights
  special. ZDoom actually sets the blending through this special instead
  of changing the colormap. To accomodate BOOM levels that use colormaps,
  it will average all the colors in the colormap together and derive a
  blend from that. Alternatively, you set the blend directly by setting
  the appropriate texture name to a hex string of the format AARRGGBB.
- Fixed barrels (again) so that barrel traps work as expected. Not sure if
  this problem existed in 1.14a or not, but it's gone now.
- Added ignoreInvisibility parameter to P_CheckSight(), because it is
  occasionally used to determine if there is an unblocked line between two
  things (not if one can see the other).
- Switched to using a logarithmic scale for pain flashes.
- Added support for Boom's push/pullers, wind, current, and friction effects.

September 26, 1998
- Saw this at the Team TNT message board:

      the bug has been found and fixed. What was happening was that the fake
	  sector was being passed instead of the real one, and this messed up
	  the check for whether a sector had had its sprites added to the view
	  already. As a result each sprite generated was being added once per
	  subsector rather than just once.

  So I went looking around in the code some and found this in R_Subsector():
  "R_AddSprites (frontsector)". I replaced frontsector with sub->sector, and
  that seems to have done the trick. A test level I made went from 15 fps to
  35 fps (the max) with this fix.

September 23, 1998
- Using -cdrom creates the directory if it doesn't exist (like it used to).
- When used with -cdrom, screenshots now get saved to C:\ZDOOMDAT instead of
  the game directory.
- Put back support for taking screenshots by pressing F1 with -devparm
  active, since some people probably won't read the docs and realize there's
  a screenshot command bound to the "Print Screen" key by default.
- Added "ticker" cvar to control display of the -devparm ticker at the
  bottom of the display (so that -devparm is now totally useless).
- Changed the directory for -cdrom from C:\DOOMDATA to C:\ZDOOMDAT and added
  support for using that directory to store zdoom.cfg.
- Fixed bug that caused using -devparm or -cdrom to crash the game during
  startup. (They referenced the Strings[] table before it was fully
  initialized.)

September 19, 1998
- Turned off screenwiping when moving between levels in a hub (but only if
  the level the player just left has LEVEL_NOINTERMISSION set).
- Fixed a savegame bug I had added with hubs that caused the game to
  forget the player's state.
- Added noise cvar to control display of sound debugging info.
- Added turn180 command to quickly turn the player around.
- Added support for the ACS thingsound(), sectorsound(), and ambientsound()
  commands.
- Changed every reference to S_StartSound so that they refer to sounds
  by name rather than id and specify priority information (since it's
  no longer a part of the sfxinfo).

September 18, 1998
- Finished S_ParseSndInfo so that it has no maximum number of sounds it
  can define and works with more than just ambient sounds.
- Changed w_wad.c back to using the buffered I/O functions again. (I had
  done this a long time ago, but thanks to some mistakes on my part, I
  ended up putting taking it out. Now it's back for good. :-) It doesn't
  seem to have any effect on disk performance, but it will let me use
  MikMod functions to load samples and MODs directly from the wad.
- Played around with MikMod some. With the assembly mixer, its
  performance seems to be about the same as MIDAS', so I will
  probably switch to it at some point.

September 17, 1998
- Improved support for analog joysticks by using their full range of
  motion instead of treating them like digital devices.

September 15, 1998
- Added support for world vars and controlling scripts on other maps.
- Added the hub clusterdef flag and supporting code.
- Figured out what the problem with hub savegames was: Instead
  of writing out a copy of the snapshots for each level with one,
  I wrote out a copy of the current level's snapshot for each
  level with a snapshot. Whoops! Easy fix.

September 14, 1998
- Worked with supporting hubs. For maps that belong to a hub,
  whenever you exit the level, the game makes a mini-savegame
  of the level. When you return, the world state is based on
  the mini-savegame. Theoretically, saving games to disk should
  be as simple as storing each of these "snapshots" along with
  some extra info, but I couldn't get it to work. The current
  level worked, but trying to go to a previously visited level
  after loading the savegame crashed the game.

September 13, 1998
- Redid my ACS code a bit so that scripts are now kept track of
  through a private linked list rather than thinkers. The only
  real advantage this offers is that I have complete control
  over when scripts get executed, so a script that executes a
  scriptwait command will be guaranteed to run in the same tic
  that the script it's waiting on terminates.

September 12, 1998
- Replaced my visplanes code with Lee Killough's hashing method
  and got a noticable performance boost in high visplane areas
  (even those with <128!).

September 4, 1998
- Added weapnext and weapprev commands courtesy of
  Papst Johannes J�rg IV. [which were later completely
  rewritten by me]
- Add support for suspending and resuming scripts (easy when
  you know you can only have one copy running at a time).
- Added checks to ensure that only one instance of a script is
  running at a time (like Hexen).

September 3, 1998
- Took out the stuff for sliding doors. You want it, then
  fake it with a script.
- Ran around in hexen.wad for a while and fixed a few bugs.
- Added support for ACS scripts (except for the sound p-codes
  and polywait).

September 2, 1998
- Added support for monsters remembering their previous target
  from BOOM.
- Made the mobj's targettic a counter that decrements to zero
  instead of a time relative to gametic (so that it works properly
  across savegames).
- Added more mobj flags bits and consolidated invisible into it.
- Implemented all the Thing_* line specials.
- Added support for stairs that reset and/or have delays and the
  sync stair builders.

September 1, 1998
- Fixed problem with several plat types that didn't deactivate
  themselves.
- Fixed bug that caused Plat_UpWaitDownStay to act like
  Plat_PerpetualRaise.
- Made NOINTERMISSION levels work by moving the check for it later
  in G_DoCompleted().
- Added HealThing special to match DamageThing.
- Added full support for the Teleport_NewMap special. Levelnum is
  actually used for something in the MAPINFO now, too.

August 31, 1998
- Implemented Hexen's thing specials that don't use tids.

August 30, 1998
- Added support for Hexen pillars.
- Finished ceilings.
- Finished floors.
- Added compression of .tch files and significantly rewrote the
  associated part of v_video.c in the process. Not quite the savings
  I would have liked: only about 57%.
- Tried using the LZ(77?) code from the Doom utilities to compress save
  games, but it was too slow to be practical. I now use minilzo which
  seems to compress about the same but is a *lot* faster. As an example
  of the kind of savings this offers, the size of a savegame on one
  level shrank to 20% of its original size.
- Used BOOM's code to remove the savegame size limit and fix some other
  savegame bugs.
- Used Killough's global boss brain state.
- Tweaked I_FatalError() so that if something really bad happens, you
  shouldn't end up in an infinite recursion sequence because Printf()
  gets called somewhere during the exit sequence.
- Implemented Floor_Waggle. Unfortunately, it's not the same as Hexen's
  since I couldn't find any decent documentation about it and also had
  a hard time determining just how every different parameter affected it
  by watching it in a test level. It's close, but not the same.

August 29, 1998
- Added support for normal (not sync) Hexen stairs.
- Added support for Hexen's phased lighting.

August 26, 1998
- Continued on floors.

August 25, 1998
- Started getting moving floors working again.

August 21, 1998
- Got plats working again.
- Switched to using a linked list to keep track of active ceilings and
  plats. This is similar to the way BOOM does it, except I store the
  list pointers in the active entities themselves rather than seperately.

August 20, 1998
- Fixed a savegame bug I had introduced. They got saved as "version 115"
  instead of zdoomsv?.dsg.

August 8, 1998 - August 15, 1998
- Did some work converting to Hexen-like line specials. Sorry, I was too
  lazy to record the specific changes.

August 7, 1998
- Incorporated BOOM's Pain Elemental Lost Soul shooting fix.
- Incorporated some of BOOM's changes to p_map.c.
- Incorporated Killough's changes to p_sight.c.

August 6, 1998
- Added snd_surround cvar to control use of surround sounds. If "0", then
  anything that would otherwise have been played surround is played
  identically from both speakers instead.
- Added cvar_defflags variable to hold any flags automatically applied to
  new cvars, the intended purpose being to allow all cvars in a config
  file to be flagged as CVAR_ARCHIVE. Useful if one port of ZDoom has cvars
  that another doesn't, but you still want them to share the same config
  file.

August 5, 1998
- Finished keyboard handler and tried to create a mouse handler for the
  DOS port.
- Switched to using PTC Mode IDs to describe video modes instead of
  bpp since the DOS version of PTC has multiple modes with the same bpp.

August 4, 1998
- Created partial keyboard handler for DOS port.

July 28, 1998
- Fixed use of config files in paths containing spaces. (I had forgotten to
  enclose the pathname in quotes when constructing the exec command string.)
- Added calls to FixPathSeperator() in a bunch of places where it was needed.

July 27, 1998
- Uploaded a quick fix to 1.14a that lets it load save games again.
- Renamed the project and workspace to zdoom (rather than doom).
- Created a version info resource for ZDoom and moved the system-specific
  files into a new win32 directory in the code tree.

July 26, 1998
- Uploaded 1.14a to notgod.com along with a source patch for 1.14->1.14a.
- If FONTA?? is available, it is now used in deference to STCFN??? (i.e.
  -file heretic)
- Renamed all the WICHAR?? in zdoom.wad to FONTB?? to match the naming
  convention used by Heretic and Hexen.

July 23, 1998
- I must be an idiot! I took a fix from BOOM for freeing the lnames array too
  soon and stuck it into ZDoom without really thinking about it. In BOOM (and
  DOOM) lnames[] is dynamically allocated. In ZDoom, it's static since it
  only needs to contain two items (the patch of the level just left and the
  patch of the level being entered). Fixed.
- Using the changemap command no longer says you are leaving the map you're
  entering when no title patch is provided. (Unless they're one and the same.)

July 22, 1998
- Added a z parameter to P_TeleportMove() to properly handle checks in the
  third dimension. Previously, I was checking for this, too, but against the
  thing's original position. Now I check against the desired z location. This
  prevents monsters from teleporting inside of each other.

July 19, 1998
- Improved handling of international keymaps (such as the French one) by
  moving all responsibility for determining the shifted state of keys into
  i_input.c. C_consol.c no longer maintains a ShiftLOT since .data3 of the
  key event will contain a character that is sensitive of the current state
  of modifier keys. (i.e. .data3 contains 'a' when the A key is pressed and
  'A' when SHIFT-A is pressed.)
- Made some changes to D_DoAdvanceDemo() and G_CheckDemoStatus() so that
  using the player setup menu during demo playback is now safe.
- Added a check to C_BackupCVars() so that it doesn't back up CVAR_LATCH
  cvars are not saved. This is unnecessary since they don't actually
  change until a new game anyway. The primary advantage of this is that
  starting a new game during demo playback now uses the selected skill
  level (again).
- Anything spawned by a boss shooter will now always telefrag even if
  LEVEL_MONSTERSTELEFRAG is not set.
- Modifed PIT_RadiusAttack() (again) so that when a barrel is doing the
  exploding, the original damage code is used.
- Removed the bitwise and against 0xff for angle in R_DrawSky() and
  R_DrawMaskedSky(). Some skies in various PWADs are wider than this, and
  R_GetColumn() masks it to the proper width for us anyway.

July 18, 1998
- Changed the unknown thing to have no gravity so that it stays at the
  height it was spawned at (useful with Hexen).
- Discovered the source of a memory leak: When I added the thing_list code
  from BOOM, I left out some from P_UnsetThingPosition(), so
  P_SetThingPosition() was always creating a new thing_list and letting the
  old one waste space. Conveyors even work now! Yay!
- Removed support for repeating the left and right arrow keys in m_menu.c
  since some people had trouble with it.
- Changed D_DoServerInfoChange() so that it doesn't print messages in
  single player games.

July 16, 1998
- Added entries for Heretic to SWITCHES and ANIMATED lumps (because I can).
- Did equivalent things for BOOM SWITCHES lumps.
- Removed MAXANIMS limit by scanning through the AnimDefs array to find out
  how many entries it contains and then allocating that many anim_t's. Also
  added support for BOOM ANIMATED lumps.
- Reduced the Revenant's height from 80 back to 56 to fix a problem with a
  trap on DOOM2 MAP27. The new height caused the revenants heads to get
  stuck in the ceiling, so the platforms they were on wouldn't lower. Since
  there are probably other situations like this elsewhere, I went and gave
  all the monsters their original heights back.
- Fixed a problem with BOOM's openings limit removal. Pointers to openings
  get stored in drawsegs, and the realloc() of the openings didn't bother
  to adjust those pointers. A simple fix in r_segs.c once I figured out what
  the problem was.
- Incorporated BOOM's Medusa fix.

July 15, 1998
- Added Lee Killough's generalized scrollers from BOOM.
- Added Rand Phares' thing list stuff from BOOM.
- Finished support for BOOM's multiple sector thinkers and threw in the
  elevator code in the process (but nothing that calls it).

July 14, 1998
- Started adding support for BOOM's multiple actions per sector.
- Uploaded the 1.14 binaries and source to notgod.com.
- Fixed bug that caused the bunny scroller to crash: Using 0 instead of
  &screens[0] in the calls to F_DrawPatchCol().
- Added support for the ML_PASSUSE flag from BOOM.
- Decided using a default texture for unknowns was too complicated to bother
  with at this point, so I took it back out. (Left in for flats, though.)

July 13, 1998
- Fixed IDKFA cheat to give the correct amount of armor.
- Slightly updated and reformated editing.txt and updated it to use
  the new ambient thing numbers.
- Reformatted and updated zdoom.txt.
- Created red and blue checkerboards that get substituted for unknown textures
  and flats.

July 12, 1998
- Created a new thing that gets substituted for unknown things in a map and
  things that are known but have no sprite frames (such as Doom II monsters
  using a DOOM I IWAD).
- Kill and kill monsters commands now get sent over the network.
- Reformatted commands.txt to make it fit on a 76-column display and hopefully
  be more readable.

July 11, 1998
- Renumbered the ambient things to the range 14001-14064.

July 10, 1998
- Renamed -nosound to -nosfx to be more compatible with most other Dooms.
- Adjusted the autoaim values used by the player setup menu to not use
  such a large range (0-5000 with big steppings in-between).
- During another deathmatch session, discovered a problem on MAP03 with
  spawn farthest. No matter what, the dead player would always spawn at
  the spawn spot near the beginning of the level. Realized that deathmatch
  spawn spots weren't recorded as 16.16 fixed point, so I adjusted
  PlayersRangeFromSpot accordingly.
- Was playing around in a deathmatch a little when I tried the changemap
  command and the game bombed out in Z_Free() because the block being freed
  didn't have a ZONEID. So I added a wrapper around Z_Free() to pass it
  the source file and line number of the caller in case this happens again.
- Discovered that I had forgotten to add the server var sending/reading
  to the netgame arbitration process, so I added it.
- Added changemap command which should be able to change the level during
  netgames and demos.
- Added support for cheat network commands so that they can work in netgames
  and demos (if desired).
- Added hack to DeHackEd support to use the original Doom thing height's
  if the thing hangs from the ceiling but the patch doesn't set its height.

July 9, 1998
- Improved wi_stuff.c so that it can still draw the level name even if a
  patch hasn't been designed for it.

July 8, 1998
- Fixed aiming. This consisted of two things: First, I needed to change
  the way I generated yslopetab and looked into it so that fullscreen
  windows and non-fullscreen had the same relative range. (Side effect:
  When the status bar is visible, you get a larger freelook range than
  before.) Second, I had to adjust my calculation of view pitch->slope
  from 0.5 to 0.75 times. I arrived at this value by standing on a cliff
  and firing a rocket launcher with different multipliers until I found one
  that looked good.
- Fixed sky scaling with different r_detail settings.
- Fixed spacing of the ammo count numbers on the fullscreen HUD.
- Hacked around in i_video.cpp and PTC's idirectx.cpp a little to support
  Mode X modes under Windows 95.
- Changed C_Drawer() so that it doesn't call C_EraseLines() if the automap
  is active, since it just creates junk on top of the automap.
- Changed the notify text drawer to use Doom's standard red text instead
  of white.

July 7, 1998
- Made several changes to the code to make it more portable and removed
  a few unused variables. DJGPP can now compile the machine-independant
  parts with only minimal warnings with -Wall.
- Thank's to gcc's -Wall, I figured out why togglemessages didn't
  work: I had left out the parentheses in Cmd_ToggleMessages
  when I wanted to call M_ChangeMessages(). Oops.
- Tried compiling r_draw.c with DJGPP and discovered that it doesn't
  like long file names, so I renamed everything to fit the 8.3 format.
  (Stupid MS-DOS! Grr!)
- Changed the midprinter to use the hu_font instead of the console font
  since it looks better and also means that the "You need a * key..."
  messages don't need special treatment in the DeHackEd code.
- Changed C_AddNotifyString() to use V_BreakLines().

July 6, 1993
- Created V_BreakLines() and V_FreeBrokenLines() to handle splitting of
  text into multiple lines. Unlike the code I had in C_AddNotifyString(),
  these will properly break lines at whitespace if possible instead of
  the middle of a word.
- Stopped using the pitch field of the S_sfx table to store the sounds'
  playback frequencies so that I can handle pitched sounds properly ala
  some magic I found in BOOM.

July 3, 1998
- Went ahead and took some code from BOOM for "kill monsters" command
  since it also kills losts souls spawned by a pain elemntal's death.
- Used BOOM's P_SetMobjState() since it has nifty state cycle detection.
- Removed a lot of stuff from cmdlib.c that I didn't actually use. (Kept
  the CRC code around since I *might* use it.)
- Discovered that taking screenshots directly inside the screenshot command
  was a bad thing because it can be called during the middle of a screen
  draw. Fixed to delay using ga_screenshot.
- Changed the gamma command into a cvar and removed the code for
  "floaters" from the options menu, since that was all they were used for.
- Fixed bug in alias code: New aliases would not properly clear the
  next field if they were the first one in a bucket.
- Aliases now get saved to the config file.
- Added "Always Mouselook" to the Options menu. I thought it was already
  there, but... It wasn't.

July 2, 1998
- Added autoexec cvar to determine the autoexec file (partially because
  Doom Legacy decided they wanted to use autoexec.cfg--just like they
  used config.cfg).
- Renamed menu_video to menu_display and added menu_video, menu_player,
  and menu_gameplay commmands.
- Moved I_WaitVBL() into i_system.c and changed it to make a simple Sleep()
  call because that's what it's really used for.
- Changed C_DrawNotifyText() to not draw when the menu is up.
- Added proper support for usejoystick and usemouse cvars in i_input.c
- Cleaned up the Convert() table in i_input.c by reformatting it.

July 1, 1998
- Tweaked PIT_RadiusAttack() to be more realistic.
- Fixed PCX writing code so that it properly indicates that the image is in
  color.

June 30, 1998
- Added Gameplay Options menu for setting dmflags.

June 29, 1998
- Documented the map command. (How did I miss this?)
- Changed the map command so that it doesn't die fatally if the specified lump
  doesn't exist.
- Borrowed some of NTDOOM's mouse input code (using Win32 functions instead of
  DirectInput), and the mouse seems smoother under NT. Use the in_mouse cvar
  to select which method of input to use.
- Added I_DetectOS() function and in_mouse cvar.

June 27, 1998
- Added DF_NO_JUMP and DF_NO_FREELOOK dmflags.
- Made -turbo parameter a normal cvar.

June 26, 1998
- Spent most of the day trying to beat MineSweeper at expert difficulty.
  Sorry. :-)

June 25, 1998
- Implemented fraglimit and timelimit cvars.
- deathmatch is also a cvar now.
- Added q2-like dmflags cvar. It adds some new deathmatch options and also
  takes over the duties of the g_falldamage and g_unlimitedammo cvars as well
  as the -fast, -respawn, and -nomonsters.
- Added one second delay until respawning after death is allowed (so that when
  noexit is active, and you hit an exit switch, you don't instantly respawn).

June 24, 1998
- Changes to serverinfo cvars now get transmitted properly in netgames, and
  only the key player can change them.
- Finally added cvarlist command and removed the multiple variations of "set".
- Added support for 8 players. Using more should now be as simple as increasing
  the MAXPLAYERS #define.
- Created brighter faceback graphics that better represent the player's
  chosen color.

June 23, 1998
- Added spynext and spyprev commands. Spynext is equivalent to pressing F12
  in the original Doom.
- Added +showscores action. It gets bound to \ by default.
- Save games now hold copies of every serverinfo cvar and the level locals.
  With Doom 1, they also contain a list of visited levels.
- The game now keeps a cumulative frag count for each player which is the same
  as what gets displayed on the status bar during a deathmatch.
- Removed "Next Weapon" from the controls menu. I need to get the inventory
  system working before I can implement it, and I don't feel like doing that
  right now.
- With a little help from BOOM, sounds in spy mode now center around the
  displayplayer rather than the consoleplayer.

June 22, 1998
- Got dynamic player translation tables up-and-running. Status bar also uses
  the translation table for the faceback instead of different patches. Automap
  now uses the player's chosen color in netgames instead of a fixed array
  of color values.
- Left and right arrow keys now repeat in the menus (for sliders).
- Continued work on player setup menu.
- Fixed C_AddNotifyString() so that it doesn't crash if passed a string with
  a newline in the middle but not at the end of the string.
- m_menu.c's text input routine now uses the user's preferred keymap.

June 20, 1998
- Continued work on player setup menu.
- Fixed a bug in V_Clear(): 8-bit modes ignored left parameter.
- Upped number of savegame slots to 8.
- Removed all alloca() calls by replacing them with Z_Malloc()/Z_Free() pairs.

June 19, 1998
- Compiled with warning level 4 and caught a few problems and potential
  problems as well as some code that was never executed. (Thanks, Grant.)
- Fixed uppercopy so that it doesn't always copy 8-chars even if the passed
  string is shorter.
- Removed <windows.h>, <io.h>, <direct.h>, and <errno.h>
  #includes from d_main.c.

June 18, 1998
- Removed R_OK #define from one of the source files and changed the typedef
  for bool in doomtype.h. Also created dxcrap.c which holds some information
  from dinput.lib and dxguid.lib since Microsoft seems to have left most of
  the Watcom DX libraries out of its DX 5 SDK.
- Started work on player setup menu.

June 17, 1998
- Got GNU diff and patch to compile under Win32. I intend to use them to
  distribute my changes to the PTC source along with the rest of the ZDoom
  source.

June 13, 1998
- Fixed a shutdown bug in the new sound code.

June 12, 1998
- Changed i_sound.c to something inspired by BOOM. It now uses MIDAS's
  auto effect channels instead of a bunch of junk left over from the
  Linux port to determine which channel to play a sound on. As a result,
  it doesn't seem to lose the player's weapon fire anymore. (Yay!)
  Also, the snd_channels cvar is now useful.
- Made spawning of unknown things in maps a warning instead of an error.
- Changed R_CheckTextureNumForName() around to use a hash table
  instead of a linear search.

June 11, 1998
- Added support for BOOM's -fastdemo parameter.
- Made MIDAS initialization failure a non-fatal error.
- Did a small change to R_InitSpriteDefs() so that it scans the list of
  sprites backwards.
- Rewrote R_PrecacheLevel() based on BOOM's.
- Found a better way to trap Alt-Space: I listen for WM_SYSCOMMAND messages
  and filter out any for SC_KEYMENU events.

June 10, 1998
- Removed Martin Howe's sprite rotation fix in R_InstallSpriteLump()
  and replaced it with something from BOOM.
- Discovered the Win32 function RegisterHotKey() and used it to trap
  Alt-Space so that it doesn't open the window's system menu. Alas,
  it doesn't seem to work with DirectDraw. :-(
- Added RGB->HSV and HSV->RGB functions to v_palette.c.

June 9, 1998
- Removed WS_POPUP style from the ZDoom window.
- Integrated the changes in PTC 0.73b with mine, and PTC stopped working
  with DirectX (again). Thankfully, I managed to get it working again.
  (Sometimes I wonder if using PTC is more trouble than it's worth...)

June 8, 1998
- Each machine now broadcasts its userinfo in D_ArbitrateNetStart() ala
  Doom Legacy 1.11.
- Userinfo settings are now properly set at game startup.
- Modified D_ArbitrateNetStart() to use the stream reading and writing
  functions for setting and retrieving some game info.
- Changed the global var startmap to be the actual name of the desired map
  and got rid of startepisode global var.
- Chat messages now get sent using special "ticcmds" instead of char-by-char
  in a normal ticcmd.
- Layed the foundation for special network commands besides user movement.
- Pressing escape in a menu now backs up one menu instead exiting the menu
  system entirely. (And backspace is now used to clear key bindings in the
  configure controls menu.)
- Menu now displays messages that don't expect any specific input without
  quickly hiding them away.
- Changed some stuff so that ZDoom doesn't grab the mouse when a menu is
  active and it's running in a window.
- Added some code so that during a demo, if a key is bound to toggleconsole,
  menu_*, sizeup, or sizedown, it will execute that command instead of
  activate the menu.
- Removed F1 screenshot hack from m_menu.c. (Use screenshot command.)
- Removed support for picking menu items with the joystick and mouse.
- Integrated the changes in PTC 0.73a with my own.

June 6, 1998
- Added -config option in GetConfigPath().
- Added messagemode and say console commands.
- Fixed C_AddNotifyString() so that it breaks lines without losing characters.
- Changed chat code to use whatever the user's selected keymap is instead of
  always Qwerty. Did the same for the console.
- Made it possible to actually send chat messages.
- Added check for chat_on to C_DoKey() so that we don't try to do something
  while the player is typing a message.
- Removed French stuff from hu_stuff.c.
- Discovered big booboo on my part. Chat hasn't been working since version
  1.11 has it? I was comparing ev->data1 with 't' in hu_stuff.c, but data1
  is a scancode, not ASCII.
- Removed RCS ID lines from all the source files. I only have RCS on my Amiga,
  and that's not the machine I'm using to develop this.

June 5, 1998
- Created some new pr_* classes for the gib throwing code.
- Removed RNG shuffling from P_Random() since it was screwing up sync in
  demos and network games.

June 4, 1998
- Made network ticcmd's variable length using the demo packing.
- Removed reference to turbomesage in G_Ticker().
- Simplified RefreshPalette() so that generating the invulnerability colormap
  uses fewer multipilies and no divides.

June 3, 1998
- Fixed P_InitSwitchList() so that the retail version is treated like the
  registered version instead of the shareware.
- Removed Martin Howe's code from w_wad.c and replaced it with a combination
  of code written by me and code from Boom. (Using hash tables speeds up
  level loading a *lot*--far more than I expected!)
- Added key repeating to the console. (So easy, I should have done it sooner.)

June 2, 1998
- Removed DEVONLY macro and added DPrintf() function.

June 1, 1998
- Fixed a bug in C_InitConsole when it reformats the console buffer. I had
  been using Printf (string); to reformat the text, but if string contained
  any sequences like "%s" I would be in big trouble. So now I use
  Printf ("%s", string);
- Fixed a problem with the invulnerability color map being wrong. I had
  been subtracting from 4278190080 when I calculated the inverse.
  (Don't know where I got that number from!) Also discovered my other
  stuff wouldn't work, so I just went and switched to fp like dcolors.c uses.
- Fixed a bug in the DeHackEd text replacement code I had introduced when
  I added support for ambient sounds. It was checking the names of all
  sound effects, but the ambient sounds start out with no names, so I
  ended up dereferencing a null pointer once I reached sfx_ambient0.

May 30, 1998
- Replaced lots of constant 35's with TICRATE (when measuring time).
- Switched to the BOOM random number generator.
- Added onfloor parameter to P_SpawnMobj() for when I actually support
  Hexen-style maps (which have a z parameter for Things).
- Changed to using mapthing2_t's internally instead of mapthing_t's.
- Created entries for Hexen-style maps in doomdata.c.
- Added a repeat byte to DEM_USERCMDCLONE to shrink demos even more.

May 29, 1998
- While recording a demo, discovered that I can't telefrag monsters.
  Must investigate.
- Added DEM_USERCMDCLONE command to indicate that this user command in the
  demo is the same as the previous one. Drastically reduced demo sizes.
- Scrapped support for my previous ZDEM format completely and adopted
  an IFF FORM instead.
- Changed all SVC_* labels to DEM_* since they have nothing to do with
  server-to-client communication and everything to do with demos.

May 28, 1998
- Got ZDEM recording and playback working again.
- Got idea from Boom: Rewrote all occurences of P_Random()-P_Random() that
  I could find so that they don't make assumptions about the order of
  execution. Old demo playback improved noticably (but it still gets out
  of sync easily). Even better, ZDEMs now appear to play back properly in
  both the release and debug builds.

May 26, 1998 - May 27, 1998
- Studied the code generated by the Hexen utility ACC and wrote a utility
  capable of disassembling BEHAVIOR lumps.

*******

May 25, 1998
- Released ZDoom 1.13
- Made gibs toggleable with testgibs cvar.
- Created zdoom.wcf file.
- Wrote some more documentation.
- Finished demo.wad
- Finished ambient sound support:
    Point random and periodic.
    World (& surround) continuous, random, and periodic.
    Limited SNDINFO lump support.
- Added the new level flags to the MAPINFO parser.

May 23, 1998
- Continued work on ambient sounds:
    Positional sounds with specific volumes work.
- Fixed intermission maps for Doom I. (I had broken them when I stopped
  identifying maps by episode and level numbers.)
- Added some more level flags to generalize behavior that had previously
  been restricted certain levels. Also removed LEVEL_SECRET and didsecret
  references, since I can now mimic them using LEVEL_VISITED.

May 22, 1998
- Started support for ambient sounds:
    Positional, continuous sounds work.
- Fixed coop intermission stats.
- Fixed bug in I_FinishUpdate() that could cause it to crash if the
  fps meter was up and it was called in very quick succession.
- Tried the following to fix the NT mouse bug:
	Read the mouse after reading the keyboard.
	Poll the mouse's position using GetDeviceState().
  Both methods failed to fix the problem. :-(
- Fixed handling of secret levels in G_WorldDone().
- Fixed problem with finale writer showing the full text of a message
  during wipes.
- Fixed display of cluster entry text in G_WorldDone().
- Discovered that R_DrawMaskedSky() doesn't work for sky textures that
  are actually masked (probably due to the way the composite texture
  generator works, but I could easily be wrong). Will investigate
  further later.
- Discovered that DITerm() was never being called, so I threw a call to
  it into I_ShutdownGraphics().
- Failure to specify a next map in the MAPINFO now repeats the current
  map instead of crashing.
- Added support for maps without music specified in their MAPINFO.

May 21, 1998
- Finished MAPINFO parser, began work on demo (and test) wad.

May 20, 1998
- Started work on a parser for MAPINFO lumps.

May 19, 1998
- Changed ST_doPaletteStuff() to be dynamic and use a larger range of
  blendings.
- Added W_FindLump() command.
- Changed W_CacheLumpNum() so that it allocates an extra zero byte after
  the end of the lump.
- Modified dehacked code to parse the patch file from memory so that
  they can be stored inside a wad file.
- Added limits command to list the state of all dynamic limits.
- Added default binding to the SysRq (Print Screen) key: "screenshot".
- Discovered the pause key wasn't getting bound by default. Fixed.
- Changed .cfg comments to anything starting with '//' rather than lines
  starting with ';'.
- Changed the default config file to zdoom.cfg and added the -config
  parameter to choose alternate ones. (Blargh! Doom Legacy decided to
  use config.cfg as its default config file, when I've been using it
  all along!)

May 18, 1998
- Tried adding support for saving TGA screenshots and discovered that PTC's
  image class doesn't actually do anything for a save.
- Changed M_ScreenShot() to accept a filename (if desired) and added a
  screenshot console command that can be used to specify one.
- Changed WritePCXFile to use ARGB values instead of RGB triples so that
  I can pass it the colors array from a palette_t.
- Bumped the screenshot limit in M_ScreenShot up to 10000 different
  images (properly this time); changed the I_Error to a simple error
  message (no reason to kill the program if you can't take a screenshot);
  and added support for dumping true color files.

May 16, 1998
- Removed the MAXSPECIALCROSS limit.
- Made palette blending dynamic and added the testblend command to
  make sure that it actually works properly.
- Moved the gamma correction stuff from v_video.c into v_palette.c.
- Fixed the color of the red player in the automap.
- Changed I_SetPalette() to take a pointer to an array of uints instead
  of RGB triples and avoid gamma correction since that should be done
  before the call to I_SetPalette().

May 15, 1998
- Added V_Clear() function to set a rectangle to a solid color.
- Added dmflags, fraglimit, and timelimit cvars. Alas, they are just
  placeholders for the moment.

May 14, 1998
- Discovered a bug in Doom Legacy's assembly R_DrawColumn while I was
  in the process of rewriting it: They were calculating (centery-dc_yl)
  when it should have been (dc_yl-centery).
- Rearranged FixedDiv_ASM() to make it pair better on a Pentium and
  aligned the main division code to a 16 byte boundary.

May 13, 1998
- Removed the next and prev links from the definition of a vissprite_t
  since they were used only for the bubble sort.
- Changed R_SortVisSprites() to use the stdlib qsort() function instead
  of a bubblesort, the end result being that scenes with a lot of sprites
  are a *lot* faster than before. For means of comparison, I played DOOM2
  MAP30 until I got MaxVisSprites up to 1824, and the lowest my framerate
  ever went was 13 fps. That's compared to my earlier run where a mere 992
  sprites slowed me down to about 3 fps.
- Fixed bug in the C-based R_DrawFuzzColumn?()s: I wasn't properly
  masking fuzzpos when I added 3 to it at the end.
- Added preliminary C-based ARGB drawers to r_draw.c. They work, but
  slower than I would like.
- Changed the main column drawers in r_draw.c into pointers that can
  point to different routines depending on the screen depth (and/or
  presence of assembly/MMX routines). This is essentially the route
  DOSDoom takes, except I didn't split r_draw.c into two files.

May 12, 1998
- Fixed the below bug. I now set dc_mask to 0xff at the beginning of
  R_DrawVisSprite() since it wasn't always large enough. A nice side
  benefit of this is that it allows for taller sprites than before.
  (Considering that I added dc_mask a few weeks ago, I'm surprised it
  took me so long to notice this!)
- Discovered a weird bug. Things were occasionally being drawn with their
  heads being repeated near their feet but still clipping to the original
  shape of the thing. In DPaint, I could do this by drawing the thing once,
  then turning the background into a stencil so I can't draw over it and
  drawing the thing lower but in the same horizontal position.

May 11, 1998
- Started adding gibs (sprite grouping in w_wad.c is always enabled now).
- Started adding support for RGB modes in various spots.
- Separated all the V_DrawPatch* functions into various wrappers and
  column drawers. This makes it easy to use the same function for both
  indexed and direct color modes and to add more (which I have done)
  without too much work.
- Created R_DrawSky() out of first part of R_DrawPlanes() for
  double sky drawing. Created R_DrawMaskedSky() that draws masked
  sky textures (i.e. the front one for a double sky); it can also
  properly tile any height sky but at a performance hit.
- Moved definition of skyiscale from r_things.c int r_sky.c and split
  it into sky1iscale and sky2iscale. Also created their inverses:
  sky1scale and sky2scale.
- Added r_stretchsky cvar to stretch the sky if it isn't taller than
  128 pixels.
- Rewrote DimScreenPLoop() so that it should be slightly faster now.
  Still has lots of AGI stalls, though. :-(

May 8, 1998
- Added detail mode setting to display options menu.
- Implemented horizontal pixel doubling.
- Added ds_colshift to go along with ds_colsize.
- Changed R_ExecuteSetViewSize() so that the view window it creates is
  always a multiple of 16 bytes wide.
- Moved definition of rowbytes out of tmap.nas and into r_draw.c and
  renamed it dc_pitch. Also created ds_colsize variable. Renamed
  ASM_PatchRowBytes() to ASM_PatchPitch() and created ASM_PatchColSize().
- Moved the call to I_BeginUpdate() in D_Display() after the call to
  R_ExecuteSetViewSize(). This lets it update the display pitch
  properly based on any changes to detailyshift. Previously, it would
  use the old pitch for one frame before switching over, which is why
  it was crashing yesterday.

May 7, 1998
- Started adding detail modes back in. Got vertical doubling working
  although I ran into a few unexpected problems. Also crashes when I
  switch from doubled to non-doubled. :-(
- Added fullscreen option to video modes menu.
- Created a "Video Modes" patch and changed the "Video Options" patch
  to "Display Options."

May 6, 1998
- Fixed the drawing of the faceback on the status bar in network games.
  (I can't believe I messed that up!)
- Added fragcount to player quit (netgame) messages.
- Added -noidle parameter to disable lowering of ZDoom's priority to
  the idle class when the window loses the focus (so that running a
  netgame on a single machine doesn't slow down too much because one of
  the sessions only receives processor time during idle moments).
- Removed the need for the leading . in IP addresses for -net.
- Added support for different ports per machine in network code.
- Changed i_net.c so that Win32 platforms now print descriptive errors.
- Fixed -net parameter so that address list can end at +commands.
- Added player obituaries.

May 5, 1998
- Adjusted options menu code so that pressing ENTER, T, and D always do
  their special functions when in the video modes menu and not just when
  the current item is of type screenres.
- Hacked double buffering into PTC's idirectx.cpp. Why? Because it
  improves compatibility with a lot of video cards under NT (like my
  old one) that don't support locking the primary surface directly.
- Mucked around in PTC's idirectx.cpp for several hours and finally got
  it to work properly in fullscreen. Yay! (I really hope a future release
  has proper support for this built in.)

May 4, 1998
- Changed (PTC's) idirectx.cpp so that it allows Ctrl-Alt-Del in
  exclusive mode.
- Looked through V_PrintStr2() and finally realized why it was crashing
  on non-MMX machines: I failed to check the status of UseMMX before
  calling EndMMX().

May 1, 1998
- Downloaded PTC 0.72. It still gets slow on the blits, but at least now
  I have the source code for it.
- Tried using PTC's BitBlt() inside I_Blit() and came across a weird
  problem: The more blits I do, the slower they get. That sucks.
- Changed the focus-losing and gaining mechanism in i_input.c. Instead
  of sending pause events, it just pauses the sound. Changing fullscreen
  video modes caused the window to lose and regain its focus a bunch, and
  it was messing up the pause sending code, sometimes leaving the game
  paused after a mode change.
- Changed R_PlaneInitData() so that it allocates the fixed_t arrays
  separately instead of all together.
- Played Blood for a little bit. That, and a prior suggestion concerning
  rocket jumping made me decide to make a slight tweak to the freelook
  code: You can now look down twice as far as before.

April 30, 1998
- Figured out why PTC clipping windowed modes larger than 512x384:
  They were larger than the initial window size! I work around it
  by resizing the window and then reinitializing PTC.
- Moved some variable declarations out of i_input.h and into
  i_input.c, eliminating some in the process.
- Realized that C_AddNotifyString() really *was* perpetuating changes
  to its input string. Now I make a copy of that and work with it to
  save myself some headaches. Plus, the const identifier is now 100%
  correct.

April 29, 1998
- Changed R_DrawColumn_ASM() and R_DrawTranslucentColumn_ASM() so
  that they check the size of the column *before* looking into
  ylookup and columnofs (thus avoiding the occasional page fault).
- Discovered that R_ExecuteSetViewSize() could be called outside of
  D_Display(). In this case it was in G_DoLoadGame(), and that
  messed things up when I used the -loadgame parameter on the command
  line. Now R_InitBuffer() locks the screen before grabbing the
  buffer pointer and pitch.

April 28, 1998
- Changed cvar() function so that if a cvar of the specified name
  exists, it still changes the cvars flags. (i.e. it gets loaded from
  the config file before this function is called.)
- Added win_stretchx and win_stretchy cvars to stretch the windowed
  display.
- Fixed hang at shutdown: wasn't decrementing counter in I_WaitVBL().
- Received and installed 128 MB of RAM and a 32x CD-ROM drive. :-)
- Got ZDoom working in a window through PTC. It doesn't do fullscreen
  yet, but that's only because I haven't written any code to handle it
  yet. It also gets into an infinite loop during shutdown. (Should be
  easy to fix.)

April 25, 1998
- Started working on PTC-ized i_video.cpp.
- Weird palette problem now. When switching modes, ZDoom will only
  very rarely set the palette properly. Me guessing it's a Win95
  problem, since I didn't see this under NT. Shouldn't really matter
  since I'm switching to PTC anyway.
- Fixed fuzzoffset[] initialization. I was using screen[0]'s pitch
  without first locking it to ensure that the value stored in the
  screen was valid.

April 24, 1998
- Discovered I have a problem adjusting the fuzzoffset[] table
  dynamically. Looks like it still keeps its old values. Will
  investigate further tomorrow.
- Finished the video modes menu. My options menu code is nowhere near
  as neat as I would have liked. Oh well...
- Implemented mode testing from the video modes menu. D_ProcessEvents()
  was hacked to make it work. (There might be a better place, but this
  was the first function I saw, and it works.)
- Figured it out: I wasn't reallocating negonearray when I resized the
  screen. Doh! Moved its initialization from R_InitSprites() into
  R_MultiresInit(). For consistancy, I now allocate screenheightarray
  and xtoviewangle in R_MultiresInit() instead of V_SetResolution(), too.
- Noticed I seem to have a problem with the playersprites now. Some
  columns aren't getting drawn completely. Which ones and how much is
  missing seems to vary depending on the game state. This is worse the
  wider the sprite is drawn. At 320 wide, I can't detect it, although
  if it covered the entire width of the screen, it would probably pop
  up. Don't know what's going on here, since it worked fine before.
  When did this happen?

April 23, 1998
- Discovered that the boolean being used in i_video.c was only a byte,
  so I looked through the standard header files, and it looks like
  rpcndr.h is the culprit with this line:
	typedef unsigned char boolean;
  Went through all my files where I've defined __BYTEBOOL__ by hand and
  changed all occurances of boolean to bool. Then I found out that that
  caused problems with variables that had been declared as boolean in
  header files, so I changed all the remaining instances of boolean to
  bool.
- Started work on the video modes menu.

April 22, 1998
- Discovered I wasn't locking the back buffer in wi_stuff.c when
  I wrote drew the background on it. Fixed.
- Added code to actual change the screen resolution and discovered I
  wasn't reallocating the VisPlanes' top and bottom arrays, so you
  couldn't switch to a screen larger than what you started with. Fixed.

April 21, 1998
- Started work on dynamic resolution changing. Most of it was already
  done when I added the multires support. Just need to change the size
  of the display surface now; everything else seems to works.
- Fixed evil bug in V_SetResolution(): I had been allocating
  xtoviewangle[] with one too few angle_t's. Ouch.
- Fixed a bug in AddToHash() that caused it to "forget" the previous
  contents of a bucket when a new entry was added to the beginning
  of the bucket.
- Added a callback to the screenblocks cvar, so that ZDoom will sense
  changes to it and adjust the screen as needed.
- ...I now allocate two screens for the status bar. If it's not scaled
  I continue drawing to the screen as before and pretty much ignore the
  second buffer. However, if the status bar is scaled, then I draw all
  the changes into the second buffer and then blit the entire thing onto
  the screen. It works, but it's also slower.
- Added support for scaling the status bar (use st_scale cvar). When I
  did this, I noticed that V_DrawPatchStretched() looks horrid when it
  draws multi-post columns, because it doesn't line them up properly.
  Plus, the areas that got updated weren't being drawn in exactly the
  same spot as what appeared on the screen, so...
- Changed status bar code so that widget coordinates are relative to
  the status bar instead of the screen, which makes the next change
  easier...

April 20, 1998
- Changed the status bar code so that the status bar surface is only as
  wide as the status bar and not the underlying screen.
- Fixed the wipe: Inside wipe_doMelt(), I had neglected to account for
  the fact that pitch desribed bytes, but d described shorts.
- Removed the use of DDraw's blitter inside I_Blit() since I was still
  having problems with it. Now I do it myself, and it works.
- Fixed blitting: needed to make sure both surfaces were unlocked.
- Got the program running again. Blitting surfaces doesn't work yet. :-(
  Neither do the wipes. (They skip every other line.)
- Removed the fractional part from the fps display.
- Got the code to a point where it builds again.

April 18, 1998
- Added new functions and changed some code in i_video.c to handle
  screens as DDraw surfaces.
- Changed R_VideoErase() to take a rect as a parameter and call V_Blit().

April 17, 1998
- Removed SCREENPITCH, SCREENWIDTH, and SCREENHEIGHT variables from
  doomdef.c. Now I need to remove all references to them.
- Cleaned up v_video.c somewhat in preparation of integrating PTC with
  the video code: created a screen_t structure; transferred SCREENWIDTH,
  SCREENHEIGHT, and SCREENPITCH into the screen_t; added some SHORT()
  macros where I had omitted them; and fixed some spots where I had
  left SCREENWIDTH intact from the original Linux code when it was really
  referring to screen pitch. Also added a small amount of code to handle
  different bit depths.
- Moved registration of vid_* commands out of c_commands.c and into
  i_video.c where they belong.
- Fixed Printf() routine in c_console.c so that it doesn't apply
  printxormask to control characters.

April 16, 1998
- Added code to i_input.c so that it puts the game in the idle priority
  class when the user switches to another window. It also pauses single
  player games now, too.
- Added some code to scroll the sky lixe Hexen. Still need to make it
  configurable, but at least I know it works.
- Tried making some taller (good-looking) skies. I sucked at it.
- Fixed R_DrawFuzzColumn_ASM so that it never draws columns slightly too
  tall. (When drawing the odd pixels before the loop, I had been using
  ebx and bl for two very different tasks. Now I use bh and bl instead.)

April 15, 1998
- Removed tutti-frutti effect for textures 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64
  units tall. Also allow textures taller than 128 units now.
- Tried holding the sky's vertical position constant when freelooking.
  IMO, it's actually worse than letting it move: You can still see it
  wrapping, and it looks weird, too. I guess I'll just have to draw
  some taller skypics if I want something that really looks nice.
- Adjusted P_FindFloor() and P_FindCeiling() to check the health of
  corpses intead of their tics to determine if they have been raised.
- Set the MT_SKULL height back to 56 units from the 30 I had previously
  set it at, since they were occasionally getting stuck in the floor.

April 14, 1998
- Stayed on MAP30 for about 1.5 hours. MaxVisSprites got bumped all
  the way up to 992, and it was slooowwww (except in the corners). Also
  noticed that the plats would sometimes get stuck going up, and I
  shot right through the resurrected corpses. Must fix tomorrow.
  Me go bed now.
- Adjusted the heights of most things to make them better match
  their image sizes. Some were okay as they were, while others were
  way off.
- Did a very quick netgame to see how things looked. Some things are
  too short (like the torches) and others are too tall (like the
  barrels).
- For all intents and purposes, 3D collision detection is now done.
  There is only one potential problem I can foresee: With enough
  vertical velocity, an object could pass right through another
  object in midair. I don't think situations like this will arise very
  often (if at all), so I'm not going to bother rewriting all my new
  code to fix it. At any rate, it's still a lot better than it used
  to be.
- Added targettic to mobj_t to create a delay before missiles can
  impact the thing that shot them. This fixes the problem of missiles
  exploding in the shooter's face before they get anywhere.
- Adjusted P_FindFloor() to search neighboring blocks in the blockmap.
  This solved the problem of occasionally falling into things. Did the
  same thing to P_FindCeiling().

April 13, 1998
- Worked on more thorough 3D collision detection code than my
  previous attempt. (At least it doesn't crash now!) FIXME:
   Missiles are often exploding right in front of the shooter's face.
   It's still possible to land inside of monsters sometimes.
- PIT_RadiusAttack() can now throw things around in three dimensions.
  The only real benefit of this is that it allows for rocket jumping.
  (Which is still pretty cool and well worth the effort of coding it.)
- Made health bonuses and muzzle flashes translucent.
- Fixed bug with Arch-Vile resurrecting a 25% or 75% translucent
  monster. Did equivalent thing for exploding missiles.
- Put idmus cheat and command back.
- Added CVAR_CALLBACK flag for non-latching cvars.
- Added map command to the console.
- Modified G_InitNew() and associated code to use skill cvar.
- Implemented proper cvar latching.
- Hooked localization code into g_level.c. This also cleaned up
  the text patching code in d_dehack.c somewhat, since level names
  and cluster messages are no longer special cases.

April 12, 1998
- Multi-language support is pretty much done. A nice benefit of this
  is that it makes DeHackEd text replacement support easier.
- -iwad and -deh parameters now automatically append the appropriate
  extension (.wad or .deh) if none is specified with them.
- IdentifyVersion() now sets gamemission according to which IWAD
  it finds.
- Removed -shdev, -regdev, and -comdev parameters.
- Fixed inadvertant bug in st_new.c that prevented ZDoom from
  working with the shareware IWAD. I had previously been loading
  the ammo patches with W_CacheLumpName() which bombs out if it
  can't find a named lump (like CELLA0 which isn't in the shareware
  WAD). Now I check for the presence of the lump before I try to
  load it.

April 11, 1998
- Created strutil utility to create string lumps for ZDoom. Also
  created source files for strutil containing the English and French
  translations. (Though English will still be stored in the
  executable as a fallback and to assist with DeHackEd patch text
  replacement.)

April 10, 1998
Not much done today:
- Added g_unlimitedammo cvar.
- Added optional fall damage code originally created by Andy Kempling.

April 9, 1998
- Fixed the pickup of health bonuses. Before, the bonuses maxed
  out at deh_MaxHealth. Now they max out at deh_MaxSoulsphere.
- Added I_SetTitleString() so that we can once again display the
  game banner at startup.
- Removed -wart parameter.
- Completely rewrote the tab completion code. :-) It still works
  the same from the end-user's point of view, but now the code is
  a whole lot cleaner and more flexible.

April 8, 1998
- Implemented tab completion for the console. The associated code
  is really convoluted, but at least it works.
- Implemented monster infighting for DeHackEd patches. It
  was really easy once I looked in the DeHackEd source and
  figured out that it was modifying PIT_CheckThing(). Too bad
  I didn't do this a day earlier...

April 7, 1998
- Updated the documentation and uploaded 1.12 to cdrom.com.
- Put the integer divide code back in FixedDiv_ASM().
  I'm pretty sure the real problem was with my overflow
  detection code, which I fixed yesterday when I put in
  the float code. It works properly now and always
  rounds down. (Some code such as the sprite drawer assumed
  that this was the case, but using floats rounded to the
  nearest integer.) I just don't understand why the problem
  didn't show up much sooner.

April 6, 1998
- Added am_showsecrets, am_showmonsters, and
  am_showtime cvars.
- Added V_DrawPatchTranslatedCleanNoMove() and
  V_DrawTextClean(). Changed console notify text
  code and automap text code to clean scale their
  text.
- Made a change to P_CrossSubsector() that ought
  to speed things up marginally.
- Fixed a small bug in P_DivlineSide() that was
  in the original id code.
- Rewrote FixedDiv_ASM() to use floating point
  math, and it worked. Also removed division by
  zero check, since it appears it's still being
  called with b==0. It looks like DOOM doesn't
  ensure that it never divides by zero and makes
  an assumption about the way FixedDiv() will
  handle these cases.
- #defined NOASM to disable the use of assembly
  routines, and it seemed to run fine. Recompiled
  with assembly routines except FixedDiv_ASM() and
  it still worked.

April 3, 1998
- This crashing stuff is getting even weirder. At
  first, if I disabled optimization in the release
  build, it went away. Now it's showing up under
  all configurations, and I haven't done anything
  to the code. I'm at a loss as to what to do. :-(
- Fixed an obscure bug in FixedDiv_ASM(). When it
  overflowed, it was popping esi instead of ebx.
  Also added a check for division by zero.

April 2, 1998
- Did some bug hunting. The problem is happening in
  P_CrossSubsector(), so it's likely something that
  happens before then, since I never touched that
  function.
- Moved the FPS drawer in I_FinishUpdate() before
  the -devparm dot drawer.

April 1, 1998
- Added Andy Baker's stealth monsters code. Upon
  tessting, a discovered the release build was still
  crashing even without loading a .deh file. My guess
  is that this is the same problem I had on the P60,
  and adding the DeHackEd code just reorganized things
  enough for the problem to show up on my machine too.
- Changed P_TouchSpecialThing() so that picking up a
  power plays a surround sound.
- Continued DeHackEd support. Most text strings now
  get replaced, and almost all miscellaneous info is
  supported as well. Still crashes in the release build.

March 31, 1998
- Continued work on DeHackEd support. Everything except
  miscellaneous info and text changing is supported.
  Unfortunately, my release build is experiencing crash
  problems not present in the debug build now. :-(
- Ripped the MHFX_LAXSPRITEROTATIONS fix out of
  DOSDoom's r_things.c.

March 30, 1998
- Started work on DeHackEd support: things, frames,
  and weapons done. Sounds mostly done.
- Added minimal code to handle changes to userinfo cvars.
- Changed player movement code to allow for very minimal
  corrections to momentum while in mid-air.
- Did a quick test of z-checking for collisions. Needs
  more work; disabled for now.
- Optimized FixedDiv_ASM() further using a neat absolute
  value trick I discovered on a website somewhere.
- Did the same thing for P_BulletSlope(). One unexpected
  twist: bullets always hit walls no matter what their slope.
- Added shoot up/down for projectile weapons with a
  quick hack to P_SpawnPlayerMissile().
- Moved ysheer out of player_t and into mobj_t as pitch.
- Changed P_ExplodeMissile() to set missile explosion
  sprites translucent.
- Changed D_DoomMain() so that it always loads zdoom.wad
  first instead of second.
- Added m_alloc.(c|h) so that I can finally check to
  make sure I get all the memory I ask for with malloc().
- Finished automap overlay. Use am_overlay cvar.
- Moved automap framebuffer boundary determination out of
  AM_LevelInit() and into AM_Drawer(). Did other mucking
  about in the automap code so it clips the automap to the
  view window when the map is overlayed on top of it.

March 29, 1998
- Jotted down some code for truecolor routines.

March 28, 1998
- Worked on automap overlay.
- Changed C_DoKey() to return true if the key generated a
  command, and false if it didn't.
- Automap can now rotate. Use am_rotate cvar to control it.
- Finished new HUD (for now). It gets the job done, and it's not
  too cluttered.

March 27, 1998
- Continued work on new options menu: Removed old sound menu.
  Created new menu title patches. Created controls menu.
  Created video menu.

March 26, 1998
- Started work on the new options menu.
- Created binddefaults command.
- Created a bunch of menu_* commands to access the different
  menus directly. Also added some of them to the default
  bindings string.
- Fixed sky height bug. The key is that skytexturemid is NOT
  resolution-dependant. It is a constant.
- Changed yesterday's sky height fix so that it is based on Doom
  Legacy's aspect ratio correction rather than what DOSDoom did.
  (BTW, this was not done in the 1.11 Doom Legacy source. :-)

March 25, 1998
- Fixed sky height with a little help from DOSDoom.
- Started work on the new HUD. Not yet sure what I like.
- Created the C version of Print2CharP_MMX. It sucks. I know there
  must be a clever way to do it using bit shifts and masking, but
  I don't feel like persuing it right now, since I have an MMX
  machine, and MMX makes it very easy to do.

March 24, 1998
- Ran ZDoom on the Pentium 60 sitting next to me. It crashed whenever
  I tried to enter a level. Some testing is obviously called for. :-(
- Added code to check for the presence of MMX support.
- Created misc.nas and moved the assembly versions of FixedMul() and
  FixedDiv() into it. Also created an assembly inner loop for
  V_DimScreen(). Also created an assembly routine to plot one conchar
  to the screen (Print1CharP) and an MMX version that doubles the
  conchar in size.
- Made command parameters in commands.txt consistant with other
  parameter lists. (<> for required params, [] for ones that aren't.)
  Also added brief descriptions of the different cvar types at the.
- Removed idmypos command. It was redundant with the
  "toggle idmypos" command.

March 23, 1998
- Added dimamount and dimcolor (defaults to gold) cvars for
  V_DimScreen() so that it can shade the screen to any color instead
  of just darkening it (although it will revert to its old behavior if
  translucency is disabled).
- Added assembly version of R_DrawFuzzColumn as well as a proper
  assembly version of R_DrawTranslucentColumn().
- Changed fuzztable in r_draw.c from 50 to 64 entries so that I can
  use a simple mask in R_DrawFuzzColumn() instead of conditionals.
  This should speed up that loop significantly (especially once it's
  in assembly). Also removed references to frac and fracstep from
  R_DrawFuzzColumn() since they weren't needed.
- Can't seem to get V_DrawPatchFlipped() to position patches properly
  (they keep getting drawn too far to the left and up), so for now,
  it just calls V_DrawPatchIndirect().
- Added special case to V_DrawPatchStretched for full-screen patches.
  Also added a scrn parameter to F_DrawPatchCol to accomodate this.
- Changed cyberdemon and spider mastermind sight and death sounds
  in the cast finale to surround.
- Changed brain's pain sound to use ORIGIN_SURROUND2. That way, the
  things it throws out won't override it.
- Added ORIGIN_AMBIENT3-4 and ORIGIN_SURROUND2-4 to s_sound.(c|h).

March 19, 1998
- Fixed UpdateCursorPosition() in i_input.c so that mouse
  sensitivity is independent of the framerate.
- Increased speed of text wipe in f_finale.c.
- Added V_DrawRedTextClean(), V_DrawWhiteTextClean(), and
  V_DrawTranslatedPatchStretched(), and V_DrawTranslatedPatchClean()
  to v_video.c.
- Fixed bug in V_DrawPatchStretched(). Was using unsigned ints where
  I should have used signed ints.
- Rewrote F_Ticker().
- Specifying -nomusic no longer causes I_InitSound() to allocate
  channels for MOD music.
- Changed several V_DrawPatch()es and V_DrawPatchDirect()s to
  V_DrawPatchClean() and V_DrawPatchIndirect() in various source files.
- Added V_DrawPatchIndirect(), V_DrawPatchClean(), and
  V_DrawPatchCleanNoMove() to v_video.c.
- Made lots of changes relating to level and cluster handling.
- Fixed problem in wi_stuff.c that prevented par times from appearing
  on Doom II levels 12 and above.

March 18, 1998
- Changed idmus command to changemus. Now it expects its input
  to be an actual song name. (Consquently, the idmus cheat is gone.)
- Moved stuff from S_music[] into LevelInfos[];
- Changed all references to leveltime, totalsecret, totalkills, and
  totalitems to level.time, level.total_secrets, level.total_monsters,
  and level.total_items respectively. levelstarttic was never used;
  got rid of it.
- Removed mapnames* arrays from hu_stuff.c and some ST_MAP* #defines
  in st_stuff.c.
- Moved drawing of level name in automap out of hu_stuff.c into am_map.c.

March 17, 1998
- Started laying the framework for better customizability of maps.
  (Any lump can be a map, use any map for the next and secret maps,
  give custom maps a name, custom par times, etc.)
- Played at 640x480 for about 1.5 hours trying to get my machine
  to crash. I have had a report of intermittant crashing possibly
  related to high resolutions, but have been unable to duplicate
  the problem on my machine. On a side note, 640x480 is way too slow.
  Doom95 does ~32 fps at 640x400, and Duke 3D does ~25 fps at 640x480.
  I get ~10 fps at 640x480 and ~12 fps at 640x400. Wish I knew how
  they do it...

March 16, 1998
- Hacked in some code into S_ChangeMusic() to allow it to play songs
  stored as individual files on disk. Added primarily because I
  have a large collection of MODs, and I don't want to be forced
  to pick which ones I want to listen to when I start the game
  (by specifying them with the -file parameter).
- Discovered the Win32 Demo Programming FAQ. Now I can disable
  code segment protection so self-modifying code can stay in
  the same segment as all the other code instead of hiding in
  the data segment.
- Put in the R_DrawColumn code from Doom Legacy. Took me awhile to
  realize that ylookup and columnofs are now pointers instead of
  arrays.

March 14, 1998
- mb_used changed to a float, so the heap doesn't need to be an
  integral number of megs in size.
- Added -heapsize parameter to set size of zone heap at run time.
- Increased size of demoname[] from 32 to 256 chars.
- Rewrote snippets of -playdemo code so that demos can be played
  from any directory and with any path.
- Removed all references to basedefault, since it's been replaced
  by configfile.
- Fixed a really dumb bug in FixPathSeperator. Was initializing
  c to progdir instead of path. Now you can add lumps in different
  directories, and still refer to them by name.
- Reformatted w_wad.c for 4 character tabs.
- Looked through the PTC archive. It needs better documentation, but
  I think I'll probably switch to it for the third release of ZDoom.

March 13, 1998
- Added back some of the stuff I had originally added to w_wad.c.
- Borrowed BT_JUMP and BT_DUCK from DOSDoom. Also added jumping code.
- IDFA and IDKFA now include the backpack.
- Downloaded Prometheus Truecolor. Trying to decide if I should use it
  for high- and true-color support.
- Added support for caching the translucency tables to disk.
  (TODO: Compress this file.)
- Added support for 25% and 75% translucency (because DOSDoom 0.60
  has it.)
- Copied w_wad.c and w_wad.h from DOSDoom 0.60. (decided not to
  bother trying to get PACK support in)
- Moved ConChars data into zdoom.wad as an ordinary patch. zDoom now
  generates the neccessary data on the fly.
- Removed MAXCEILINGS limit. (was 30)
- Removed MAX_DEATHMATCH_STARTS limit. (was 10)
- Removed MAXPLATS limit. (was 30)

March 12, 1998
- Rewrote P_FindNextHighestFloor() so that it doesn't use an internal
  array (thus also removing the MAX_ADJOINING_SECTORS limit).
- Removed some files from the code directory I had added but never used.
- Removed MAXSEGS limit. (was 32.. What are solidsegs anyway?)
- Removed MAXDRAWSEGS limit. (was 256)
- Now allocate R_DrawSprite()'s clipbot and cliptop arrays inside
  R_MultiresInit() instead of each time the function is called. Should
  have done this in the first place, but I obviously wasn't thinking.
  One particularly sprite-laden scene went from ~25 fps to almost 35 fps.
- Created R_MultiresInit() function. Now V_SetResolution() calls it, and
  it calls the various R_*() functions related to supporting multiple
  resolutions.
- Changed the default am_gridcolor to a decent color that actually fits
  with the rest of the color scheme.
- Took a cue from WinDoom and split my keyboard handler between the
  DirectInput code and the window's message handler. Ugly, but at least
  now it handles Pause and Alt-Tab properly. (The original problem with
  Alt-Tab, incidentally, was that I was failing to reacquire the keyboard
  when I regained the input focus.)
- Inserting text at the command line in the console now works properly.
- Pressing ` to hide the console now clears the command line. This is
  the same behavior as Quake, but previously only Escape would clear the
  command line in ZDoom. I found that to be too annoying.
- Pressing up and down arrow keys in the console to scroll through the
  history now ensures that the cursor is always visible.
- Changed BuildString() so that if it is called with argc==1, it just
  returns a copy of the string unmodified instead of sticking it in
  quotes if it contains a space.
- Renamed setcolorbyname to setcolor. The former was just too long.
- Added setcolorbyname command and corresponding V_GetColorStringByName()
  function and X11R6RGB lump listing a bunch of named colors.

March 11, 1998
- Added crosshair cvar and corresponding code to draw the crosshair.
  Put some cheezy crosshairs in zdoom.wad, too. (Now if only you could
  actually aim up and down...)
- Added V_DrawLucentPatch() function to draw translucent patches.
- Added freelook, lookspring, lookstrafe, m_pitch, m_yaw, m_forward,
  and m_side cvars.

March 10, 1998
- Added invertmouse cvar.
- Put the colon back into the "startskill..." message in d_net.c.
- ylookup[] and columnofs[] tables in r_draw.c are now allocated
  dynamically based on screen size. Hacked this into R_InitFuzzTable().
- Status bar finally properly draws borders to the left and right
  of itself if the screen is wider than it is.
- Added documentation for am_* and developer cvars in commands.txt.
- Discovered that lines not yet seen but visible thanks to the
  automap powerup were not color-configurable. Changed it.
- Changed all color #defines in am_map.c into ints that get
  initialized from color values in cvars each time
  AM_initVariables is called. Also added back support for the
  original automap color scheme regardless of what the user's colors are
  through the am_usecustomcolors cvar.
- In single player, automap can now draw the player's arrow using
  any color and not just WHITE.
- Removed all references to lightlev in am_map.c, including the
  AM_updateLightLev() function. The "strobe" effect was really cheap
  anyway, never used, and will be fairly difficult to implement
  cleanly when I make the automap colors customizable.
- Changed I_Error() call in ParseHex() to a Printf() call.
- Removed "extern byte *demo_p;" from d_protocol.c. It didn't need to
  be there anyway.
- Added V_GetColorFromString() to v_video.c.
- Changed BASEYCENTER #define in r_things.c from
  (100-((SCREENHEIGHT-200)/12)) to (100). PlayerSprites are now drawn
  in approximately the same location at all resolutions.

March 9, 1998
- Seem to have finally fixed the problem with my visplane growing
  code. Using calloc() in PrepVisPlanes() instead of malloc() seems
  to have solved all my woes. Now on to something else!
- Boy do I feel dumb. Found a bug in C_DrawConsole () where the
  revealed variable wasn't always being set before it was used.
  Now I rewrote it so that it doesn't need to calculate
  revealed at all. It ought to be marginally faster, too (although
  it probably won't make a bit of difference during gameplay).

March 7, 1998
- Still working on MaxVisPlanes bug. This is proving to be more
  elusive than I had expected, since VC++ is being most unhelpful.
  The bug doesn't show up in the debug build (heap checking doesn't
  even catch anything), and I can't use the debugger on the release
  build where the bug does show up! Grrr!

March 6, 1998

- Started changing MAXVISPLANES constant into the growing integer
  MaxVisPlanes. Moved some code from R_PlaneInitData() to
  R_InitPlanes() and added the GetMoreVisPlanes() function to
  allocate more planes. Strange crashing bugs in release but not
  debug builds. Probably stomping on memory somewhere.
- Fixed stupid bug in I_ShutdownSound: was calling MIDASfreeSample()
  when I should have been calling MIDASfreeChannel(). Also moved
  freeing of channels to another for loop (probably not necessary, but...).
- Fixed -file parameter to work with console commands on the
  command line.
- Changed MAXVISSPRITES constant into the integer MaxVisSprites,
  which is the size of the vissprites[] array. This value can now
  grow as needed to accomodate more vissprites.
- Added developer cvar and DEVONLY macro.
- Functions in i_music.c now pay attention to the looping flag.
- C_AddNotifyString() now pays attention to show_messages cvar.
- Added support for specifying console commands on the command line.
